# Gym Tracker — Design & As‑Built Spec

A single‑file, offline‑first progressive‑overload gym tracker plus an exhaustive
exercise reference. Everything (UI, data, exercise library, glossary, anatomy chart)
lives in **`gym-tracker.html`** — no build step, no dependencies, no network. All
user data is stored in the browser via `localStorage`, with optional file/folder
sync on Chromium desktop.

Guiding principle surfaced throughout the UI: **beat last session** — more reps,
more weight, or more sets. Strength sets are compared with estimated 1RM,
`e1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30)`.

The feature backlog lives in **`Fitness App Features.xls`** (legacy BIFF `.xls`).
Status legend used there: **DONE** shipped · **ONHOLD** deferred.

## 1. File architecture

`gym-tracker.html` is one HTML document with three top‑level `<script>` blocks that
share the global scope:

| Block | Role | Key contents |
|------|------|--------------|
| **1 — App logic** | The tracker | `FAMILIES` (compact, machine‑readable exercise data with UUIDs), state & storage, auto‑save/load, themes, settings drawer, volume/muscle model, muscle/cardio analytics, gyms, body comp, log modal, **`render()`** (tracker) |
| **2 — Reference & glossary** | The reference panel | `icons`, `exercises` (rich human‑readable docs sharing the same UUIDs), importance/difficulty ratings, body‑position tables, `glossary`, anatomy chart, **`renderRef()`** (reference) |
| **3 — Nav switcher** | Top‑bar panel switching | `switchPanel()`, build stamp |

Two parallel exercise datasets are intentional: **`FAMILIES`** drives logging,
the picker, volume and tracking; **`exercises`** drives the reference documentation.
They share variation **UUIDs**.

> **Latent bug fixed earlier:** both blocks declared a global `function render()`;
> block 2's reference one clobbered block 1's tracker one after load. The reference
> function was renamed **`renderRef()`**. An init simulation (`node` + DOM stub) is
> used to confirm all three blocks evaluate with no runtime errors and that every
> render path executes. It has since caught real bugs (a `GYM_EQUIP` TDZ; a string
> escaping error) before they shipped.

### Panels, tabs & overlays
- **Top bar:** title · `📈 Tracker` / `📚 Reference` tabs · `📖 Glossary` · `⚙ Settings` · `? Help`
  (Reference vs Glossary now use distinct emoji — feat 48).
- **Tracker panel** tabs: `Log` · `History` · `Volume` · `Trends` · `Body` · `Gyms`.
- **Reference panel:** searchable/filterable movement library.
- **Overlays:** Settings drawer, Help panel, Glossary panel (with anatomy chart), Log modal, Notes modal.
- The Glossary overlay relocates to `<body>` on open so it works from any panel and is themed globally.

## 2. State & storage

- `STORAGE_KEY = overload_tracker_v2` — the full `state` object (JSON).
- `PENDING_KEY = overload_tracker_pending_v2` — in‑progress log entry (incl. cardio / superset drafts).
- `LOG_KEY = overload_tracker_log_v1` — **separate** activity/error log; kept out of the data JSON.
- `SETTINGS_KEYS` — keys preserved on *merge* import / replaced on *overwrite* import.
- `normalizeState()` backfills nested defaults so older saved state stays valid.

### `state` shape (high level)

## 3. Feature catalog (as built)

### Data, backup & import/export — DONE
Export/import JSON (merge vs overwrite); auto‑save / auto‑load to file or folder with
deletion policies (Chromium); settings inside the JSON; CSV export of the reference.

### Profile & preferences — DONE
- **Profile (34):** name, DOB→age, height, gender → BMI / relative‑strength context.
- **Hold‑to‑confirm (32):** press‑and‑hold replaces yes/no popups on destructive buttons.
- **Highlight → glossary (31):** select & hold text 5s to open the matching entry.

### Themes (22, 47) — DONE
**43 themes in 10 categories** — Classic, Grimdark, Animanga, Neon, Elemental, Mono, Gemstone, **Coffee, Bloom, Dusk**
— with oblique thematic names. The 5 original themes use CSS `[data-theme]` blocks; the rest are
**palette‑driven** via `mkTheme()` → CSS custom properties applied inline by `applyTheme()`.

### Workout session dashboard — DONE
Start/End (12) with confirmation (13); auto‑start/auto‑end; workout score vs prior sessions;
live chunky estimate (14); pace algorithm (28); balanced‑physique advice (15); per‑element
visibility toggles (33). **Forerunner stats (25):** manual avg HR / max HR / calories attached to
any session via an inline ❤️ editor on the session card.

### Tracking modes — DONE
`exMode()` classifies a variation as **standard** (weight×reps), **bodyweight** (added load; − =
assist; shows effective load — feat 26), **distance** (carries — feat 27), or **time** (holds — 27).
**Cardio (feat 6)** is a fully separate path: `isCardioVar()` (mega `cardio`) routes the log modal to
`renderCardioForm()`, which captures elapsed time + optional distance/steps/power/setting/calories/
effort(1–5)/temp/weather/notes. Cardio entries store `cardio:{}` with empty `sets`, so they are
**excluded from volume, scoring, trends and progression history** but render with their metrics in
the session/history views.

### Plate loader (41/42) — DONE
For barbell movements (`isBarbellVar`), an optional collapsible loader in the sets form: pick a bar
(default 45 lb / 20 kg + variants), tap plates per side, see the live total, and **“Set as weight”**
fills empty sets and becomes the default weight for newly added sets. Symmetric only; a note explains
asymmetric is reserved for a few obscure lifts.

### Supersets — DONE (two distinct features)
- **Post‑hoc link (39):** a `⇄` button links a logged exercise with the one above it (shared `supersetId`).
- **Obscure real‑time superset (43):** a discrete “⇄ Superset two exercises” entry in the picker lets you
  pick exercise A then B, then add sets of **either** in any order; saved as two `supersetId`‑linked entries.
  Changing the chosen exercise discards the in‑progress superset, and a normal in‑progress set cannot be
  converted into a superset (you start superset mode fresh from the picker).

### Volume & muscle analysis — DONE
Body‑part, **per‑muscle (9)** and **per‑head (29)** views from a muscle model + per‑family contribution
map; adjustable **weightings (10)** scaling MEV/MAV/MRV targets with **cited sources** and revert‑to‑default;
imbalance **presets (11)**; over/under‑doing sort. **Cardio goals & adherence (7):** a card on the Volume
tab sets weekly minutes/distance/sessions goals and shows this‑period adherence bars (hidden when cardio
category is hidden).

### Categories visibility (8) — DONE
Settings → Categories hides **cardio / mobility / recovery** entirely: `categoryHidden()` removes them from
the picker (via `varVisibleInPicker`) and suppresses their features (e.g. cardio goals).

### Body composition (24) — DONE
`Body` tab: manual Garmin Index S2‑style entry (weight, body‑fat %, muscle/bone mass, water %), kg‑canonical,
displayed in lb/kg; BMI from latest weight + profile height; history with deltas.

### Reference, variations & glossary — DONE
Hide flags + reset (23); custom variations (16, manual‑flagged, removable only if unlogged, basis selectable);
built‑in extras (17/18 — Roc‑It dip/leg press/leg extension/leg curl/abdominal & oblique crunch, Life Fitness
torso rotation, hack‑squat foot positions, sissy hack squat); same‑stimulus alternatives with cues (19);
top‑bar glossary (20) & help (21); bodybuilder/lore entries (40) in a `Lore` category — **with no personal
lifespans (feat 45)**; **anatomy chart (30)** as a clickable left pane, bidirectionally cross‑linked to entries.

### Gyms (36/37/38/44/46) — DONE
Gym management is its **own tab (46)**. Define gyms by available equipment, build **from a template**,
select the **active** gym (overrides hide flags / force‑shows specific exercises), pin **GPS** (manual,
“pin here”, or **paste a Google Maps link / lat,lng — feat 44** via `parseMapsLatLng`), and a Maps **search**
link. Workout start pings location to auto‑select the nearest saved gym (≤2 km).

### Activity & error log (35) — DONE
Ring‑buffer event log in its own storage key; global error capture; in‑drawer viewer; export to `.txt`.

### Deferred — ONHOLD
- **#49** — Make the anatomy chart toggle to externally‑attached, more richly detailed charts and ensure the
  glossary covers everything on them. (Requires source charts that aren't provided; the built‑in stylized
  chart + comprehensive anatomy glossary ship today.)

## 4. Notable design decisions
- **Palette‑driven theming** keeps each new theme to a single data entry, no per‑theme CSS.
- **Runtime injection over editing giant literals** for custom + built‑in‑extra variations.
- **Single picker‑visibility source of truth** (`varVisibleInPicker`) composes category‑hide, gym rules,
  hide flags and custom flags; gym force‑show wins for specific exercises.
- **Cardio is data‑shaped to opt out of strength math**: empty `sets` means every volume/score/trend
  function ignores it automatically; a guard in History skips zero‑set entries.
- **Separate log storage** so JSON export/import stays clean.
- **Headless validation harness** (`node` + DOM stub) runs all blocks and exercises every render path.

## 5. Known limitations
- Per‑muscle distribution is directional (explicit map for major lifts, even split otherwise), not lab‑accurate.
- The anatomy chart is a stylized schematic (see ONHOLD #49 for the richer‑chart follow‑up).
- Auto‑save/load and GPS need Chromium / geolocation permission; file handles reset on reload.
- Editing one of several cardio bouts of the *same* machine in a single session targets the first match.
- `parseMapsLatLng` reads coordinates from common Google Maps URL forms or a plain `lat,lng`; it does not call any Maps API.
