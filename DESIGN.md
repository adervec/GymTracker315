# Gym Tracker — Design & As‑Built Spec

A single‑file, offline‑first progressive‑overload gym tracker plus an exhaustive
exercise reference. Everything (UI, data, exercise library, glossary, anatomy chart)
lives in **`gym-tracker.html`** — no build step, no dependencies, no network. All
user data is stored in the browser via `localStorage`, with optional file/folder
sync on Chromium desktop.

Guiding principle surfaced throughout the UI: **beat last session** — more reps,
more weight, or more sets. Strength sets are compared with estimated 1RM,
`e1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30)`.

The feature backlog lives in **`Fitness App Features.xls`** (legacy BIFF `.xls`).
Status legend used there: **DONE** shipped · **ONHOLD** deferred.

## 1. File architecture

`gym-tracker.html` is one HTML document with three top‑level `<script>` blocks that
share the global scope:

| Block | Role | Key contents |
|------|------|--------------|
| **1 — App logic** | The tracker | `FAMILIES` (compact, machine‑readable exercise data with UUIDs), state & storage, auto‑save/load, themes, settings drawer, volume/muscle model, muscle/cardio analytics, gyms, body comp, log modal, **`render()`** (tracker) |
| **2 — Reference & glossary** | The reference panel | `icons`, `exercises` (rich human‑readable docs sharing the same UUIDs), importance/difficulty ratings, body‑position tables, `glossary`, anatomy chart, **`renderRef()`** (reference) |
| **3 — Nav switcher** | Top‑bar panel switching | `switchPanel()`, build stamp |

Two parallel exercise datasets are intentional: **`FAMILIES`** drives logging,
the picker, volume and tracking; **`exercises`** drives the reference documentation.
They share variation **UUIDs**.

> **Adding/removing a variation touches BOTH datasets.** Put the variation in the readable
> `exercises` block (full cue/setup/movement/mistakes/programming/position docs) **and** in the
> compact `FAMILIES` JSON (`{id, uuid, title, cue, tip, warning, best, subvariation}`) under the
> matching family — using the **same UUID** in both. Editing only `exercises` documents the move
> but leaves it unloggable (it won't appear in the tracker picker); editing only `FAMILIES` makes it
> loggable but undocumented. (E.g. the Freemotion functional-trainer variations — feat 59.)

> **Latent bug fixed earlier:** both blocks declared a global `function render()`;
> block 2's reference one clobbered block 1's tracker one after load. The reference
> function was renamed **`renderRef()`**. An init simulation (`node` + DOM stub) is
> used to confirm all three blocks evaluate with no runtime errors and that every
> render path executes. It has since caught real bugs (a `GYM_EQUIP` TDZ; a string
> escaping error) before they shipped.

### Panels, tabs & overlays
- **Top bar:** title · `📈 Tracker` / `📚 Reference` tabs · `📖 Glossary` · `⚙ Settings` · `? Help`
  (Reference vs Glossary now use distinct emoji — feat 48).
- **Tracker panel** tabs: `Log` · `History` · `Volume` · `Trends` · `Body` · `Gyms`.
- **Reference panel:** searchable/filterable movement library.
- **Overlays:** Settings drawer, Help panel, Glossary panel (with anatomy chart), Log modal, Notes modal.
- The Glossary overlay relocates to `<body>` on open so it works from any panel and is themed globally.
- **Glossary view (feat 59):** opens as a full page by default, or a right-side slide-in drawer
  (Settings → Reference → *Glossary view*, persisted as `glossaryAsPage`, default `true`). Same panel and
  content either way — page mode just drops the slide animation/backdrop and goes edge-to-edge. The panel's
  z-index sits above the top bar so its header/✕ are never occluded in either mode.
- **Settings drawer cleanup (feat 60):** the drawer template stays flat (`.drawer-section-title` + sibling
  rows); after every render, **`decorateSettingsSections()`** wraps each title + its following siblings into a
  collapsible `.drawer-section`, so the giant template is untouched. A header search box (kept *outside*
  `#settings-drawer-body` so it survives re-renders) drives **`applySettingsFilter()`** for row/section-level
  filtering. Collapse state is persisted in `state.settingsCollapse` (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`, so it survives reloads
  and is kept on merge-imports); the **Theme** section is collapsed by default (43 swatches were the bulk) and
  shows the active theme as a header hint. Theme swatches were also compacted (6 cols, 24px dots).
- **Internationalization groundwork (feat 61):** `t(key, params)` resolves a string for the active language
  (`state.lang`, persisted in `SETTINGS_KEYS`; default *and only* option `'en'`) with **current → English → raw
  key** fallback and `{name}` interpolation. **`applyI18n(root)`** translates static markup tagged with
  `data-i18n` (text) / `data-i18n-title` / `data-i18n-aria` / `data-i18n-placeholder` (attributes) and runs on
  load and on every **`setLang()`**. Adding a language is **data-only**: push to `LANGUAGES` (code + native name)
  and add a matching `I18N[code]` dictionary — the Settings → *Language* picker (built from `LANGUAGES`) and the
  switch machinery handle the rest. Only the top bar + settings chrome are wired so far; JS-rendered strings use
  `t()`, and section titles can be translated safely via a `data-sec-id` override (keeps collapse IDs stable).
- **Read-only mode (feat 62):** `state.readonly` (Settings → Preferences, default off). `isReadonly()` +
  `roBlocked(action)` gate the main write paths (`saveSets`, `startWorkout`/`endWorkout`, `deleteExercise`,
  history set-delete, `importData`, `saveBodyEntry`, `saveNotes`, gym add/delete/edit, reset-all); `render()`
  toggles a `body.readonly` class that hides the FAB and shows the `#ro-banner` indicator. Settings/preferences
  stay editable (so the mode can be turned back off).
- **Choice dialog + unsaved-set guard (feat 62):** `choiceDialog({title, message, choices})` is a reusable
  promise-based 3-button modal. `endWorkout()` now checks `hasUnsavedSets()` (unsaved sets sitting in `pending`)
  and forces **Save & end / Discard & end / Continue** before finishing via `finalizeEndWorkout()`. `saveSets()`
  now returns `true`/`false` so the dialog knows whether the save succeeded.
- **Biometric freshness (feat 63):** bodyweight exercises (`exMode().mode==='bodyweight'`) can't be saved with no
  recorded bodyweight (`getCurrentBodyweightKg()`). `startWorkout()` surfaces `biometricWarnings()` — bodyweight
  missing/stale by default (`warnStaleBodyweight`), other biometrics opt-in (`warnOtherBiometrics`, default off),
  threshold `biometricStaleDays` (default 14 ≈ 2 weeks). Configured in Settings → *Biometrics*.
- **OSK Next/Done swap + About (feat 62):** the on-screen numpad's *Next* and *Done* swapped places (Next → header,
  Done → primary action). Settings → *About* now carries an **Early Access** disclaimer, a *Built by Adam Eryavec,
  P.Eng. with Claude Code* credit, and the `APP_BUILD` stamp.
- **OSK calculator + log-set fixes (feat 65):** a persistent 🧮 toggle adds `( ) ÷ × − +` keys and a safe
  BEDMAS evaluator (`evalExpr`, input restricted to arithmetic) so `45+45×2` commits `135`. `addSetRow` now
  enforces ≤1 incomplete row (no more stacked blanks); the exercise picker re-renders results-only on keystroke
  (`renderPickerResults`/`bindPickerResults`) so the search ✕ no longer jiggles.
- **TTS + UI polish (feat 66/67):** `speakRandomTip()` reads a random cue/tip aloud on exercise select
  (`state.ttsTips`, default on). App-wide `user-select: none` (form fields exempt) — supersedes the old
  highlight→glossary gesture. Tips & Details has an *Open full reference entry* link (`openReferenceFor`).
- **Workout metronome (feat 69):** customizable audio+haptic beat (`state.metronome`: bpm/audio/freq/vol/haptic/
  accentEvery, in `SETTINGS_KEYS`). Engine is a `setInterval` ticker driving a WebAudio click + `navigator.vibrate`;
  on/off is **runtime-only and resets OFF on `startWorkout`/end**. Toggle + BPM ±5 live on the Log tab during a
  workout; full config in Settings → *Metronome*.
- **Muscle-volume roll-up fix (feat 69):** `MUSCLE_CONTRIB` uses head-level ids (e.g. `biceps-long/short`); the
  `'muscle'`-level Volume view never rolled them to the parent (`biceps`), so multi-head muscles read blank and
  only single-part muscles like **brachialis** showed. `getWeeklyMuscleVolume` now applies **`toMuscleContrib`**
  (head→parent) for muscle level, mirroring `toHeadContrib` for head level.
- **Workout plans (feat 70):** `state.plans` (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`, seeded once from `SEED_PLANS` — 8 plans:
  PPL / Upper / Lower / 2× Full Body / Core). A plan = `{id, name, steps:[{id, sets, options:[{type:'movement',
  familyId} | {type:'variation', uuid}]}]}` — ordered, **suggested-not-enforced** steps; each option is a whole
  movement or a specific variation. Optionally attached to a session via **`session.planId`** (changeable/
  abandonable mid-workout). On the Log tab `renderPlanGuide` shows the plan card (per-step `logged/target` sets,
  current/done state, tap-an-option to log it, **live ETA** from `computePlanETA` = remaining sets ×
  `computeRestStats` set+rest times, and a **⚠ gym** warning via `stepImpossibleInGym` when an active gym can do
  none of a step's options). The feat-55 auto PUSH/PULL/LOWER/CORE suggester (`computeRemainingWork`) is gated to
  run **only when no plan is attached**. The plan creator (the **`plan-creator` router page** since feat 184; was the
  `#plans-panel` overlay) is a full builder: list → editor (name, add/reorder/delete steps, per-step set count, add
  movement/variation options via a search picker) → use.
- **Plan descriptions, history & more plans (feat 71):** plans and steps carry an optional `desc` (shown on the
  card, list, and editor). Seeding is now **additive by id** with a `state.seededPlanIds` ledger (new seed plans
  append for existing users; deleted ones don't reappear) and **backfills descriptions** onto pristine seed
  plans. Library grew to **15** with rich theme/benefit blurbs, including **station / one-zone** plans (Squat
  Rack Strength, Dumbbell Corner, One Cable Station, Bench + Dumbbells) for staying posted up when the gym is
  packed, plus Arms Blaster / Glute Focus / Beginner Full Body. History (`renderSession`) shows a **plan badge**
  with full/partial completion (`stepStatus` over the session). The reference page's circular glossary **FAB was
  removed** — the top-bar 📖 is the single entry point.
- **Heart-rate monitor (feat 72):** **Web Bluetooth** (`navigator.bluetooth`, Android Chrome/Edge only) against the
  standard Heart Rate Service (`0x180D` / `0x2A37`) — connects to a BLE strap or a watch in *broadcast HR* mode
  (it cannot tap a watch bonded to its own app, or the phone's health store). `hrConnect()` (user gesture) picks +
  remembers the device in **`state.hrDevice`**; **`hrTryReconnect()`** auto-reconnects via `getDevices()` on load
  and at `startWorkout`, and a `gattserverdisconnected` retry loop keeps trying to get it back. Samples stream into
  **`session.hrSamples` = [[msFromStart, bpm], …]** at ~1 Hz (throttled saves); `hrFinalize` rolls them into
  `session.hr` avg/max on end. A Log-tab `renderHrBar` shows live BPM + connect/disconnect; **`renderHrChart`** draws
  the per-session trend with **set periods shaded** (`set.wTs→ts`) so the rise-during-set / recover-during-rest
  pattern is visible in history. Manual HR entry (feat 25) stays as the iOS fallback.
- **Garmin biometrics import (feat 73):** a browser cannot read Garmin directly (no public per-user API, internal
  Connect endpoints are non-CORS + behind SSO, no web access to the phone health store), so data arrives as a **file**.
  Body tab → **"Import biometrics"** (`#bc-import-btn`) reads a JSON or CSV via `importBiometrics()` →
  `parseBiometrics()`. **JSON** shape `{bodyComp:[{date, weightKg, bodyFatPct?, muscleMassKg?, boneMassKg?,
  bodyWaterPct?}], sleep:[{date, score?, note?}]}` (also accepts `weightLb`/`*MassLb`); **CSV** is tolerant — columns
  detected by header keyword (date/weight/fat/muscle/bone/water), unit inferred from the weight header (`lb`/`kg`,
  else `state.bodyCompUnit`). `normBiometricEntry()` normalizes to the canonical `bodyComp` entry (kg, noon-UTC date,
  rounded), merged **dedupe-by-calendar-day** exactly like `saveBodyEntry`. Sleep rows are matched to a workout's
  calendar day (`dayKey` anchors date-only strings to noon UTC so they don't slip a day in western TZs) and written to
  **`session.sleep`** (a short string, e.g. `"Score 78 · 7h12m"`), surfaced + editable in the workout-stats card
  (feat 25) and shown as `😴 …` in history. **`tools/garmin-sync.py`** (community `garminconnect` lib) logs in locally
  with the user's own credentials and writes that JSON from Index S2 body-comp + last-night sleep score. Kept lean:
  one optional sleep field, no per-metric ingestion beyond the S2 set.
- **Biometrics auto-load (feat 73):** Settings → Data → **"Biometrics Auto-Load (Garmin)"** picks a file or folder
  (`bioLoadPickFile`/`bioLoadPickFolder`) and **always merges** (never overwrites) — independent of the main
  Auto-Save/Load; `state.bioAutoLoad{enabled,mode}`. Unlike the main Auto-Load (memory-only handles), the handle is
  **persisted in IndexedDB** (`gymtracker-fs` store; tiny `bioIdbGet/Set/Del` wrappers) so it survives reloads.
  `bioLoadNow(silent, interactive)` restores it, checks `queryPermission` on boot (silent, no prompt) /
  `requestPermission` on the **Sync Now** gesture, then imports via `importBiometrics(text, {silent})`. Folder mode reads
  the newest file matching `bio|garmin|weight|gymtracker` (`.json|.csv|.txt`) by last-modified. Boot hook fires
  `bioLoadNow(true,false)` after the main auto-load. `importBiometrics` now takes `{silent}` and returns
  `{added, sleepN}` for status reporting.
- **Sound & haptics quick control (feat 74):** a top-bar button (`#app-sound-btn`, left of the glossary icon) opens a
  themed popover (`#sound-menu` + transparent backdrop, anchored under the button via `getBoundingClientRect`) to
  mute/adjust master **Audio** (toggle + volume slider) and **Haptics** (toggle), with a **Test** button and a
  "Sound settings →" link to the drawer. New master gate **`state.sound{audio,haptics,volume}`** (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`,
  normalized + volume-clamped) is enforced inside the four audio/haptic primitives — `safeVibrate` (haptics gate),
  `restBeep`/`metroBeep` (audio gate + `sndVol()` scaling), and `speakRandomTip` (audio gate + `u.volume`) — so one
  switch silences everything app-wide. Helpers `sndAudioOn/sndHapticOn/sndVol`. The icon reflects live state via
  `refreshSoundIcon()`: speaker glyph by volume (🔇/🔈/🔉/🔊) plus a 📳 badge shown only when haptics are on, and a
  dimmed `muted-all` state when both are off. Called on boot and after every change. Below the master controls a
  **"Per sound"** section (`soundSources()`) exposes the individual channels as 🔊/📳 chips wired straight to their
  settings — Metronome (`metronome.audio/haptic`), Rest cues (`workoutControls.feedbackBeep/feedbackVibrate`) and
  Spoken tips (`ttsTips`); the master switch still gates them all. Menu scrolls (`max-height`) on short screens.
- **Exercise reference media (feat 75):** attach form-reference clips (YouTube / Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels)
  to a variation and review them in a swipeable carousel popup. **`state.exerciseMedia{[uuid]:[{platform,vid,
  embedUrl,watchUrl,url,addedAt}]}`** (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`, normalized to `{}`), keyed by variation uuid — the same id
  Reference and Log Sets share. **`parseMediaUrl`** normalizes a pasted link → platform + embed URL: YouTube/Shorts/
  youtu.be/m. → `youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ID`, TikTok `/video/ID` → `tiktok.com/player/v1/ID`, Instagram
  `/reel|p|tv/CODE` → `/embed`; short links (`vm.tiktok`) and unknown hosts become **link-only** cards, non-domains are
  rejected. `add/get/removeExerciseMedia` (add is read-only-gated + de-duped). The **`#media-modal`** popover has a
  **carousel** mode (horizontal scroll-snap slides, lazy iframes loaded via `IntersectionObserver` so only the visible
  clip streams, dots, 9:16 frames / 16:9 for YouTube, an Open ↗ fallback when a clip can't embed — nothing is cached)
  and a **manage** mode (paste-to-add input + list + remove); empty opens to manage. Entry points: a 🎬 button in every
  Reference variation badge-row and a "🎬 Reference videos (N)" button in the Log-Sets exercise header.
  **Two levels:** media attaches to a **variation** (`v.uuid`) *or* a whole **movement** (`ex.id` = `fam.id` =
  `info.family.id`, shared across datasets). A variation's carousel — in Reference and Log Sets — merges its own clips
  **plus its movement's** (`openExerciseMedia(uuid, title, movementId)` → `combinedMediaItems()` de-dupes by embed/url
  and tags each slide "This variation"/"Whole movement"); manage mode shows one add/remove section per level. The
  Reference movement header has its own "🎬 Movement" button. `refreshMediaCounts()` recomputes every `[data-media-label]`
  badge (variation-only, movement-only, or combined via `data-media-mov`) without a re-render.
- **Reference compact views (feat 76):** a Detailed / 🌳 Tree / ▦ Table toggle (`#ref-view-toggle`, persisted in
  **`state.refView`** ∈ SETTINGS_KEYS) at the top of the Reference panel; `renderRef()` branches to `renderRefTree` /
  `renderRefTable` before its detailed render. **Tree** = collapsible movements → compact variation rows; **Table** =
  one row per variation (Movement · Variation · Group `megaBadge` · Meta). Both flag attached metadata *without* showing
  details via `refMetaBadges(uuid, movId)` — **📝** note (feat 54, per-variation) and **🎬**(+count) video links (feat
  75, own row only); the 🎬 badge opens the carousel (`stopPropagation`), tapping the row elsewhere calls `refDrillTo` to
  jump to the full detailed entry (expanded + scrolled, toggle re-synced). `syncRefViewToggle` keeps the segmented
  control in sync.
- **Strava reconciliation (feat 77):** link logged workouts to Strava strength activities (usually watch-synced). A
  browser can't reach Strava directly (OAuth needs a client secret + no CORS), so activities arrive as a **file**:
  `tools/strava-sync.py` (stdlib-only OAuth + `/athlete/activities`, writes `strava-activities.json`; `--push` PUTs
  descriptions back) or a Strava bulk-export `activities.csv`. **Settings → Data → Strava**: Import → `parseStravaActivities`
  (JSON raw-API or normalized, or quoted-CSV) → `normStravaActivity` → merged into **`state.stravaActivities`** (∈
  SETTINGS_KEYS, dedupe by id). `reconcileStravaBuckets()` does a **greedy 1:1 start-time match** (±`STRAVA_MATCH_WINDOW_MIN`
  = 120) into **linked / proposed / gymOnly / stravaOnly** (`isStrengthType` filters WeightTraining/Workout/etc). The
  reconcile overlay (`#strava-modal`, reuses the media-modal box) lists the buckets with per-row **Link / Unlink**, **Link
  all**, and **📋 copy description**; `linkStrava` sets `session.stravaId` and **enriches** the session (backfills
  `hr{avg,max,calories}` if empty; derives `endedAt` from `elapsed_time` for past sessions). `stravaDescriptionFor`
  builds an exercise/top-set/volume summary; `exportStravaPush` writes a `strava-push.json` for the script. `strava-token.json`
  + generated sync files are git-ignored.
- **Equipment "X Setup" pickers in the OSK (feat 78/79):** seven loading tools (`SETUP_KINDS`) — **Barbell** (renamed
  from Plate Loader; bar + per-side plates, smith via bar option), **Dumbbell** (per-hand / total-×2), **Kettlebell**
  (single / double), **Medicine Ball**, **Plate Picker** (plate sum), **Landmine** (loaded-end plates + optional bar),
  **Pin Setup** (stack stepper with adjustable increment + add-on **toppers**) — surfaced two ways from one source of
  truth via a namespace `ns` (`'inl'` | `'np'`): the **inline** sets-form panel (`renderSetupInline`, only when the OSK
  is off) and the **OSK** strip (`renderNpSetup`, top of the numpad on a weight field) — a chunky **"{icon} {label}:
  {total}"** button + a ⚙ configurator (`renderSetupBody`/`bindSetup`); tapping commits the weight and advances to reps
  (`commitSetField` → `numpadNext`). **Default assignment is per-variation**, not family-wide: `autoSetupKind` reads the
  variation's own title/id tokens (e.g. "Smith"→barbell, "Roc-It"→pin, "MTS/Iso-Lateral"→plate, "Landmine/Meadows",
  "Goblet"→dumbbell), excludes bodyweight (`exMode` + title) and time/distance, and for silent strength variations falls
  back to the **family's primary (first-listed) `equip`**. A per-variation **override** (`state.exerciseSetup`, ∈
  SETTINGS_KEYS) via the in-configurator Tool selector sets a specific tool or **None**. State is `modalState.setup[kind]`
  / `modalState.setupOpen` (reset per exercise); `setupTotal`/`plateSum` compute the loaded weight.
- **Pin profiles + picker graphics (feat 80):** Pin Setup gains **named machine profiles** — `state.pinProfiles`
  (`[{id,name,inc}]`, ∈ SETTINGS_KEYS): a "Machine profile" row of saved-stack chips (tap to apply that machine's
  increment, ✕ to delete) plus **＋ Save** (names the current increment via `prompt`); the active one is tracked on the
  pin state's `profileId`. And every picker now shows a **stylized theme-matching SVG glyph** via `setupIconSvg(kind)`
  (barbell/dumbbell/kettlebell/med-ball/plate/landmine/pin, `stroke="currentColor"` so it inherits the button's accent)
  in place of the emoji on the chunky OSK button and inline toggle/header.
- **Live loaded-barbell illustration (feat 81):** `renderBarbellSvg(st)` draws the plates actually on the bar inside
  the Barbell Setup configurator — symmetric, largest plate inside-out, **height ∝ weight**, theme-coloured by size band
  (`--accent` / `--accent2` / `--text3`), with a `+N more per side` label past 11 plates. Built from the same
  `st.plates` map, so it updates live on every add/remove.
- **Baseline-adaptive plans + intensity/ETA (feat 82):** plan steps carry a relative **`load`** (`light`/`moderate`/
  `heavy` → 0.7/0.85/0.95) and plans a **1-5 `intensity`**. `baselineWeightVar` (heaviest set in the most recent
  session that trained a variation) × `loadFactor(load)`, rounded to the unit increment, yields a **suggested working
  weight** shown per step in the plan guide ("heavy · ≈190lb", with a "% of baseline" tooltip). Starting a step seeds
  that weight into the first set **and pre-loads the matching equipment picker** (`_planLoadCtx` threaded through both
  `startExerciseFromSuggestion` and the picker-tap path → `seedSetupForWeight` → `solveSetupState`: `greedyPlates` solves
  a barbell/plate/landmine loadout, `nearestInList` snaps dumbbell/kettlebell/med-ball, pin rounds to its increment).
  `estimatePlanMinutes` (≈2.5 min/set + 1/exercise, **rounded to 15 min**) and `intensityDots` show on plan cards + the
  guide. Six new seed plans (Heavy Lower, Upper Hypertrophy, Express 30, Posterior Chain, Powerbuilding A, Athletic Full
  Body); `intensity`/`load` backfilled for existing users in the seed-merge.
- **Plan video (feat 83):** a plan can carry **one** attached web video — `plan.media` (a normalized `parseMediaUrl`
  item, persisted on `state.plans`). Attached/removed in the plan editor (paste a YouTube/Shorts/TikTok/Reel link →
  Attach; shows platform + Preview/🗑). Watched read-only via `openPlanMedia(planId)`, which reuses the feat-75
  `#media-modal` through a new explicit-list path: `_mediaCtx.items` makes `combinedMediaItems` return the given clip(s)
  and `renderMediaModal` hides the Manage button (editing lives in the plan editor). A 🎬 button surfaces on the plans
  list row and a "🎬 Watch" on the live plan guide.
- **Bulk exercise-media population (feat 84):** a browser can't enumerate a creator's YouTube Shorts or hold a Data-API
  key, so matching runs in **`tools/youtube-media.py`** (stdlib; resolves a channel handle → uploads, keeps Shorts
  ≤~60 s, fuzzy-matches video titles to exercises by token coverage, emits real `/shorts/<id>` URLs only where matched —
  no fabricated IDs). **Settings → Data → Exercise media**: `exportExerciseList()` dumps
  `{movements:[{id,title}], variations:[{uuid,title,movement}]}` for the script; `importExerciseMediaMap()` ingests the
  result `{media:[{uuid|id|match, url, source?}]}` → `resolveExerciseKey` (uuid → id → normalized exact/contains title)
  → `parseMediaUrl` → merged into `state.exerciseMedia` (de-duped; reports added/unmatched/dup/bad). Default channels:
  `@fitonomycoaching`, `@pathradecha`.
- **Deferred-trio cleanup (feat 85):** (1) **Equipment setup now persists within a workout** — the picker no longer
  wipes `modalState.setup` on every exercise switch (only collapses `setupOpen`); it's cleared instead at `startWorkout`
  and `finalizeEndWorkout`, so a loaded bar/dumbbell/pin config carries by type across exercises. (2) **Plan builder edits
  load + intensity** — `renderPlanEditor` gains a 1–5 intensity pill row (per plan) and a light/moderate/heavy load pill
  row per step (`data-plan-intensity` / `data-step-load`), so custom plans drive the feat-82 suggested weights too. (3)
  **Resizable SETS panel** — the sets list lives in `.sets-section` with a sticky header and a `.sets-scroll`
  (`resize: vertical`, `max-height`, internal scroll), and `.tips-content` is capped at `38vh` with its own scroll, so a
  long Tips section can never bury the sets.
- **Themed dialogs everywhere (feat 86):** every remaining native `confirm()`/`prompt()` is replaced by themed,
  Promise-based dialogs built on the `choiceDialog` sheet — `confirmDialog(msg, {title,okLabel,danger})` → `Promise<bool>`
  and `promptDialog({title,message,placeholder,…})` → `Promise<string|null>` (with a `.choice-input`). Converted sites:
  end-workout, reset-all, delete-all-history (now a 3-way export/delete/cancel `choiceDialog`), delete-set, delete-exercise,
  clear-notes, custom-variation name, pin-profile name, and `guardedConfirm`'s fallback. **`saveSets` is now async**
  (`Promise<boolean>`): the commit logic is extracted into an inner `commit()` gated behind `confirmDialog`, and its one
  return-value caller (the end-workout "Save & end" path) was updated to `.then`. No `confirm`/`prompt`/`alert` calls
  remain.
- **Smith/custom bar + assign-picker-from-Reference (feat 87):** Barbell Setup gains a **custom bar weight** input
  (`data-{ns}-barcustom` → `st.bar`) alongside the preset pills, and detects **Smith** variations (`isSmithVar`, title/id
  match) — `barbellBars()` swaps in counterbalanced-carriage presets (`[15,20,25,45,0]` lb), `defaultSetupState` seeds a
  lighter 25 lb / 15 kg default, and the body shows a "Smith carriage — effective weight" label + note. And the
  per-variation **loading-tool override** (`state.exerciseSetup`) is now assignable **from the Reference panel** too: each
  variation body with a relevant tool shows a `🛠 Loading tool` `<select>` (Auto · {detected} / 7 kinds / None) wired to
  `setSetupOverride` — which also lets you re-enable a tool after setting it to None.
- **Mix sub-variations in one log (feat 88):** a default-OFF setting (`workoutControls.mixSubvariations`, Settings →
  Workout Session) lets you pick a **sub-option per set** for exercises that have a subvariation (grip/bar/angle). When
  on (and not editing), each set row in the Log modal gets a `.set-sub-select` (`data-set-sub` → `set.subUuid`); on save
  `saveSets` tags each valid set with its sub and **groups them into one exercise entry per sub** (so each grip tracks
  separately under its own `varUuid|subUuid`), stripping the temp field. Off (default) = the original single-sub
  behaviour; editing mode always uses the one selected sub.
- **Strava activities auto-load (feat 89):** mirrors the feat-73 biometrics auto-load for Strava — `state.stravaAutoLoad
  {enabled,mode}` (∈ SETTINGS_KEYS), `_stravaLoad{File,Dir}Handle`, and `stravaLoad{NewestInDir,Apply,Now,PickFolder,
  PickFile,Disable}` reusing the same `bioIdb*` IndexedDB handle store (keys `stravaDir`/`stravaFile`). Pick a folder/file
  (e.g. where `strava-sync.py` writes); the handle persists across reloads, and on boot (`stravaLoadNow(true,false)`) +
  "Sync Now" it imports the newest `strava|activities|gymtracker` file via `importStravaActivities(text,{silent})` (which
  gained a silent option) — always merging. Settings → Data → Strava shows the auto-load controls (gated by
  `autoLoadSupported`).
- **Coaching & Progression tab + new disciplines (feat 90):** a third top-level panel (`panel-coaching`, 🧭) built
  from the bundled `/Guides` (endurance reference, bouldering, Captains-of-Crush grip). `renderCoaching()` builds three
  cards (Endurance / Bouldering / Grip & Digit Strength) from a `COACHING` data array — distilled cues, zone models,
  progression protocols and the CoC gripper ladder. **Crosslinking:** each card's chips call `openInReference(search,
  mega)` (sets `#ref-search` / clicks a mega pill, then `switchPanel`); a guide chip opens the full bundled guide; and
  the Reference panel carries a `coach-banner` back to the tab (`goPanel`). **New trackable families** arrive via a new
  `EXTRA_FAMILIES` + `applyExtraFamilies()` injector (mirrors `EXTRA_VARIATIONS`, pushes whole families into `FAMILIES`
  + `VAR_INDEX` + the Reference `exercises`): `neck-training` (mega `neck`), `jaw-training` (mega `jaw`), and `climbing`
  (mega `cardio`, so `isCardioVar()` logs **bouldering as a cardio session**). Grip/digit work (pinch hold, support
  hang, thick-bar, finger-extension band) is added to the existing `grip-training` family via `EXTRA_VARIATIONS`; the
  keyword-driven `exMode()` already routes holds/hangs → time and the rest → weight×reps. **Trainable muscles updated:**
  `forearms`, `neck`, `jaw` added to `BP_LABELS` + `BODY_PARTS`; a `FOREARM_FAMILIES` override in `getBP()` reclassifies
  grip/wrist work (sourced as `pull::arms` → biceps) to `forearms`, and `BP_MAP` gains `neck::strength`/`jaw::strength`/
  `cardio::climbing`. Covered by `test/coaching.spec.mjs`.
- **Guides baked into the single file + in-app themed reader (feat 91):** the three `/Guides` HTML docs are
  embedded into `gym-tracker.html` as inert, marker-delimited `<template id="guide-*">` blocks by
  `tools/embed-guides.mjs` (idempotent — re-run when a guide changes; strips their external font `<link>`s to stay
  offline). The Coaching tab's guide chips are now buttons → `openGuide(gid)` opens a full-screen reader
  (`#guide-reader`, z-index above the app chrome) whose `<iframe srcdoc>` = the template's HTML +
  `buildGuideTheme()`. That override reads the app's **live** theme (`getComputedStyle` of `--bg/--bg2/--bg3/--text/
  --text3/--accent/--border2` + the body font) and injects it over each guide — remapping bouldering's CSS variables
  (`--paper/--ink/--tape`…) and the hard-coded dark palettes of the coc/endurance guides — so all three adopt the app
  theme + font (bouldering flips from its light "field-guide" look to dark). The iframe still runs each guide's own
  script, so the collapsible coc cards and the data-driven endurance reference (69 topics built at runtime) keep
  working. The app is now fully self-contained — distribute `gym-tracker.html` alone. `test/check.mjs` strips the
  `GUIDES:START…END` block so the embedded guides aren't linted as app code. The reader (which covers the app's top
  nav) is escapable three ways: a prominent **✕ Close** button (safe-area-padded so it clears a phone notch), the
  **Escape** key, and the **device Back button** (open pushes a history entry; `popstate` closes the reader without
  leaving the app).
- **UI tap feedback on every button (feat 92):** `state.uiFeedback {audio,haptic}` (default **ON**, ∈ SETTINGS_KEYS)
  drives a single capture-phase `click` listener (`uiTapFeedback`) on `document`. For any interactive target —
  `_uiFeedbackTarget()` matches semantic controls (`button`/`a`/`[role=button]`/`[onclick]`/`select`) or, for the app's
  clickable divs, walks up to 4 ancestors looking for `cursor:pointer` — it plays a crisp `uiClickSound()` (a short
  1100→620 Hz triangle blip on the shared `_restAudioCtx`) and a `safeVibrate(8)` buzz. Both still route through the
  feat-74 master gates (`sndAudioOn`/`sndHapticOn` + volume), and a new **"Button taps"** row in the sound quick-menu
  toggles the audio/haptic independently. Capture phase means it fires even when a handler stops propagation; text
  inputs (cursor `text`) are skipped. Covered by `test/feedback.spec.mjs`.
- **Installable HTTPS PWA + deploy (feat 93):** the app ships as an offline-first PWA on GitHub Pages.
  Added `manifest.webmanifest` (standalone, dark theme, 192/512/maskable icons generated by
  `tools/make-icons.mjs`, which rasterises a branded dumbbell SVG via the Playwright we already depend on),
  a `sw.js` service worker (network-first for the document so it's fresh online + cached offline,
  cache-first for assets; cache `gt-cache-<build>` stamped from `APP_BUILD` at deploy, old caches purged on
  activate), and `<head>` meta + manifest/apple-touch links + an inline SW registration (skipped on
  `file://`; toasts "reopen to apply" when a new SW is waiting). `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs the
  static check, embeds the guides, assembles `_site/` (`gym-tracker.html`→`index.html` + manifest + sw +
  icons, `__BUILD__` stamped) and publishes to Pages on push to `dev`. `gym-tracker.html` stays the
  single-file source; the PWA files are deploy artifacts. `test/check.mjs` validates the PWA assets and
  `test/pwa.spec.mjs` checks the manifest, head wiring, and that the SW registers + caches the shell.
  *(Phase 1 of the PWA + Google-Drive-sync plan; data-model hardening + Drive sync follow.)*
- **Open-source / going-public legal (feat 94):** added a top-level `LICENSE` (MIT, © 2026 Adam Eryavec)
  and a single in-app disclaimer source, `legalDisclaimerHtml()`, surfaced in both **Help** (a "Disclaimer
  & licence" section) and **Settings → About** (a collapsible `<details>`): not-professional-advice +
  exercise-at-your-own-risk, no-warranty (MIT), trademarks-belong-to-owners / not-affiliated (Captains of
  Crush, Hoist/Roc-It, Life Fitness, Strava, Garmin, …), data-stays-local, and a references note. A license
  + disclaimer banner comment heads `gym-tracker.html`. README gained Disclaimer / Privacy / Trademarks /
  License sections + a MIT badge; `tools/garmin-sync.py` and the README flag that the Garmin helper uses the
  *unofficial* `garminconnect` library (Strava/YouTube helpers use official APIs). Audit confirmed: no
  bundled third-party libraries (vanilla single file; Playwright is a dev-only Apache-2.0 dep), no committed
  secrets, no remote fonts/CDN/trackers. Covered by `test/legal.spec.mjs`.
- **Sync data model (feat 95):** the foundation for cross-device Google Drive sync (Phase 2 of the plan).
  Every session now carries a stable `id` (`newSession()` → `crypto.randomUUID()`) + `updatedAt`; existing
  sessions are backfilled on load (`normalizeState` sets `updatedAt = endedAt || date` but **NOT** an id — so
  two devices migrating the same legacy session don't fork into duplicates; legacy sessions key by date).
  Deletions push a tombstone to `state.deletedSessions [{id, deletedAt}]` (`deleteExercise` session-removal,
  the full `finalConfirmDeleteAll` wipe; pruned > 1 yr). `touchSession()` bumps `updatedAt` on the non-set
  edits (cardio, notes, sleep, HR, Strava link); set logging needs none since `sessionTs()` already takes the
  newest set `ts`. `applyImport()`'s merge mode was rewritten from a naive date-merge into a **last-write-wins
  union**: sessions keyed by `id || 'd:'+date`, newest `sessionTs` wins, tombstones drop a session only when
  the deletion is at least as new as its last edit, and settings do a coarse whole-object LWW via a
  `saveState`-stamped top-level `savedAt`. Covered by `test/sync.spec.mjs`.
- **Tracker button press timing (feat 96):** `state.trackerPress { shortMs, longMs }` (default `{0, 2000}`, ∈
  SETTINGS_KEYS, in Settings → Preferences) defines a **short tap** (released ≥ `shortMs`; 0 = instant) vs a
  **press-and-hold long-press** (held ≥ `longMs`) that fires a *separate* shortcut, for Tracker-tab buttons.
  `longMs` is always kept ≥ `shortMs` + 1 s. `attachTrackerPress(btn, onShort, onLong, label)` classifies the
  press (reusing the `attachLongPress` `lp-holding` fill + a haptic on long-press; a release under `shortMs` is
  ignored as an accidental tap). The long-press time also now drives the existing destructive **hold-to-confirm**
  (`attachLongPress` defaults its hold to `trackerPress.longMs`). Specific per-button long-press shortcuts are
  wired on request. Covered by `test/press.spec.mjs`.
- **Tracker log UX pass (feat 97):** removed the wasted "Gym management moved" disclaimer from Settings; capped
  the in-modal Tips panel at 22vh (was 38vh) so an open Tips section no longer pushes the Sets pane off-screen;
  made the **on-screen numpad the default** (`workoutControls.onScreenNumpad`), which moves the plate/pin/bar
  **equipment setup into the keypad as a ⚙ toggle** (`renderNpSetup`) instead of the inline configurator — keeping
  the Sets pane visible on mobile; added rep-range **ghost text** under the numpad when entering reps (Strength
  1–5 · Hypertrophy 6–12 · Pump 15–20+). Also extended `attachTrackerPress` (feat 96) with a **two-phase progress
  indicator**: a charging fill toward `shortMs` (the accidental-tap "arming") then toward `longMs`, with an
  `lp-armed` accent-tint once the tap is valid (an instant tap with no long action shows nothing). Covered by
  `test/press.spec.mjs`.
- **History outlier review (feat 98):** `findOutlierSets()` scans weighted (standard-mode) history and flags a
  set as a likely **data-entry slip** when its weight exceeds the configured limit (`maxWeightLb`), its reps are
  absurd (> 100), or its e1RM is more than 3× this exercise's own median (needs ≥ 4 samples as a baseline — robust
  to the outlier itself). The History list prepends a **⚠️ review card** with per-set **Keep** (sets `set._ok`, a
  vetted flag that travels in export/sync so a confirmed-real PR is never re-flagged) and **Delete** (removes the
  set, prunes an emptied exercise, tombstones an emptied session). Read-only mode blocks edits. Covered by
  `test/history.spec.mjs`.
- **Top-bar long-press shortcuts (feat 99):** each top-bar icon gains a press-and-hold shortcut layered over its
  normal tap. `attachTopbarLongPress(btn, onLong, label, holdMs=550)` reuses the `.lp-holding` progress fill, fires
  a confirm haptic, and **swallows the trailing click** via a *document* capture-phase listener (so it beats the
  button's earlier-registered inline `onclick`). Shortcuts: **🔊** mute audio + haptics (`topbarMuteAll`); **📖**
  glossary search of the current muscle target (`BP_GLOSS_TERM[bp]` → `openGlossaryTo`); **📚** open the current/last
  variation in Reference (`openReferenceFor`); **⚙️** jump to the most recently changed setting (a drawer-body
  change/click listener records `state.lastSettingAnchor {id,sec}`; `openSettingsToLastChanged` expands the section,
  scrolls, and flashes it); **🧭** scroll Coaching to the most relevant card (`coachingCardForExercise` →
  endurance/bouldering/grip); **❓** unchanged (tap == hold). `currentOrLastExercise()` (active log → newest history)
  is the shared context. Covered by `test/topbar.spec.mjs`.
- **Numpad digit long-press ×10 (feat 100):** an on-screen-keypad digit **tapped** appends as before, but **held**
  (≥ 400 ms) from an *empty* field enters that digit ×10 (hold `7` → `70`) — a fast path for round numbers. With
  digits already present, or in calculator mode, a hold is just a normal short press. `bindNumpadKeys` now routes
  digit keys through `attachNumpadDigit` (self-contained pointer tap/hold, no document listener — safe under the
  numpad's frequent re-render) and the shared key logic was extracted to `numpadHandleKey(k)`. The ×10 fires
  `numpadHandleKey(k)` then `numpadHandleKey('0')`, shows a `×10` hold hint + the `lp-holding` fill. Covered by
  `test/numpad.spec.mjs`.
- **Rename "subscription" → "subvariation" (feat 101):** the variation sub-option concept was historically named
  `subscription` (a confusing word implying payment). Renamed the data property (`variation.subvariation`), every
  accessor, the `subvariations` lookup table, the `.var-subvariation` CSS class, the Trends `subvariation` dimension +
  its tab label, and comments — 819 lowercase + 2 capitalized occurrences, a same-length swap (both words are 12
  chars) so byte size is unchanged. **Safe** because persisted user data keys by `subUuid`, never the word
  `subscription`; the rename is confined to the static `FAMILIES`/`exercises` datasets and code. (Aligns with the
  already-"subvariation" `workoutControls.mixSubvariations` control.)
- **History filtering + time bounds + all-time link (feat 102):** the History list gains a filter bar —
  a **time window** (`HISTORY_RANGES`: all / year / 6mo / 3mo / month / week) plus cascading **body part → movement
  → variation** dropdowns and a debounced **text search**. State lives in `state.historyFilter
  {range,bp,family,varKey,q}` (device-local, not in `SETTINGS_KEYS`). `historyAggregate()` rebuilds the per-key
  stats over only the sessions/sets passing the window + filters (`exPassesHistoryFilter`); `historyFilterOptions()`
  builds the dropdown options present in-window, honoring parent selections so they cascade. The list is split into
  its own `#hist-list` so the text search re-renders **list-only** (keeps input focus); dropdown changes do a full
  re-render. A variation's **detail** now respects the window and, when one is active, shows a **🕘 View all-time**
  link (`#trk-all-time`) that drops the window. The outlier-review card (feat 98) was extracted to
  `buildOutlierReviewHtml()` and stays **filter-independent** (data hygiene is always surfaced). Covered by
  `test/historyfilter.spec.mjs`.
- **Metronome mantra mode (feat 103):** a `metronome.mantra` toggle (Settings → Metronome) makes the metronome
  **chant the current exercise's setup cues** on each beat instead of beeping — a looping, hypnotic form reminder.
  `metroNextMantraTip(ex)` cycles `collectExerciseTips(ex)` (cue / tip / family setup·movement·mistakes) by a module
  index; `metroSpeakNextTip` speaks it via `speechSynthesis`, guarded by `_metroSpeaking` (waits for the previous
  utterance's `onend` so a fast tempo doesn't clip words — the cues self-pace to speech length) and the master audio
  gate. The target exercise is the pending log exercise, else `currentOrLastExercise()`. `stopMetronome` cancels any
  in-progress chant. Covered by `test/metronome.spec.mjs`.
- **Metronome set-active gating + rest-cue timer (feat 104):** two parts. (1) `metronome.setActiveOnly`
  (**default on**) makes `metroTick` stay silent unless `metroSetActive()` (an open set — weight entered, reps
  pending) so the beat only sounds while you're actually repping; an Off pill restores free-run. (2) A **separate,
  configurable audible rest timer** `state.restCues {enabled,mode,target,interval,countdown,endCue,audio,haptic,freq}`
  (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`, default **off**), independent of the recommended-rest zone beeps. `restCueTick()` (hooked into
  the 1 Hz `restTick`, fires ≤ once per integer second via `_lastRestCueSec`) emits, during same-exercise rest:
  **count-up** interval beeps + an end cue at `target`; or **countdown** interval beeps, a per-second tick over the
  final `countdown` seconds, and a distinct triple end cue at zero. Countdown mode also shows `⏳ remaining` on the
  rest bar. Both configured in Settings → Metronome / Rest timer cues. Covered by `test/restcues.spec.mjs`.
- **Headphone-only audio (feat 105):** `state.audioHeadphonesOnly` (**default on**) suppresses *audio* output (every
  beep/cue/TTS — never haptics) unless it's routed to headphones, so the app never blares through a phone speaker in
  a public gym. Browser output detection is **best-effort**: `probeAudioOutput()` reads `audiooutput` device labels
  (`enumerateDevices`, refreshed on `devicechange`) and matches a headphone/bluetooth regex. `headphoneGatePasses()`
  blocks **only** when the setting is on AND we *positively* detected speaker-only (`_headphonesConnected === false`);
  when labels are hidden (no permission) or the API is absent it **fails open** (`null` → allowed) so audio is never
  silently broken. The gate is added to the four audio emitters (`metroBeep` / `restBeep` / `uiClickSound` /
  `metroSpeakNextTip`) + `speakRandomTip`. Settings shows live status + an optional **enable-detection** link
  (`unlockHeadphoneDetection` — a one-off `getUserMedia` to reveal device labels, then stops the track). Covered by
  `test/headphones.spec.mjs`. *(Caveat: on Android Chrome without the optional permission, labels are hidden →
  detection is unknown → fail-open, so the gate is effectively inert until the user enables detection.)*
- **Auto-connect HR on workout start (feat 106):** `workoutControls.hrAutoConnect` (**default on**, toggle in
  Settings → Workout, only shown when `hrSupported()`) gates the existing `startWorkout()` → `hrTryReconnect()` call,
  so each workout silently re-attaches your last heart-rate monitor (no chooser) — or not, if you turn it off. The
  reconnect uses `navigator.bluetooth.getDevices()` (no user gesture needed for a remembered device). Covered by
  `test/hrconnect.spec.mjs`.
- **Change-exercise / add-note buttons + picker escape hatch (feat 107):** the log modal's **Change exercise** and
  **Add note / edit** controls became real `<button>`s (proper tap targets + button styling) instead of tiny
  underlined text spans. And because tapping Change exercise opens the picker without clearing `pending.varUuid`, the
  picker now renders a **← Back to {current}** button (`#trk-picker-back-current`, shown when there's a current
  exercise and you're not editing/superset-picking) that sets `showPicker = false` to return to the in-progress
  exercise unchanged — recovering a mis-tap. Covered by `test/changeexercise.spec.mjs`.
- **Long-press End Workout skips the confirm (feat 108):** the **End Workout** button now uses `attachTrackerPress`
  (feat 96/97) instead of `setupConfirmButton`: a **tap** runs `endWorkout(false)` (the themed confirm dialog), a
  **long-press** runs `endWorkout(true)` (ends immediately, skipping the popup) — with the two-phase charging
  progress indicator, and independent of the global hold-to-confirm setting. A hold shorter than the threshold still
  falls back to the confirm dialog (accidental-press safety). Covered by `test/endworkout.spec.mjs`.
- **Data management as its own page (feat 109):** all data rows (Export/Import JSON, Export Workout/CSV, Activity
  Log, Auto-Save, Auto-Load, Biometrics, Strava, bulk Exercise media, Reset) moved out of the Settings drawer into a
  full-screen **Data Management page** (`#data-page`). Implementation avoids relocating ~340 lines of HTML + bindings:
  the sections still render inside the drawer wrapped in `#drawer-data-wrap`, and `renderSettingsDrawer` then **moves
  that wrapper node** (with its already-attached event listeners riding along) into `#data-page-body` — leaving only
  an "📦 Open Data Management →" entry button in Settings. `openDataPage()`/`closeDataPage()` toggle it; re-renders
  (from data actions) rebuild + re-relocate, so the page stays live. Covered by `test/datapage.spec.mjs`.
- **Desktop bulk media wizard (feat 110):** a desktop-only full-screen tool (`#media-wizard`, gated by
  `isDesktopWizard()` = File-System-Access support or a wide fine-pointer viewport; entry button in the Data page's
  Exercise-media section) to manage reference links across **every** exercise at once. `renderMediaWizard()` lists
  variations (search, "with media only" toggle, capped at 150) each with their links; per link: an embeddable/link-only
  badge, **↗ open** (new tab — the "test"), **→ move** (`reassignMedia` to another variation via an inline 2-char
  search picker), **✕ delete**; per row an **add-link** input. **↻ Re-test all** (`mediaWizardRetestAll`) re-parses
  every link to refresh `embedUrl`/platform. Reuses the existing `parseMediaUrl`/`add`/`removeExerciseMedia` API.
  Covered by `test/mediawizard.spec.mjs`.
- **Plan-progress dashboard (feat 111):** `renderPlanGuide` now shows, per step, **sets hit** (`logged/target ✓`) and
  an **effort badge** (`stepEffort` — did the heaviest logged set reach the step's `load`-derived target weight,
  within 3%; n/a when there's no baseline) plus a live roll-up line (`planExecutionSummary`: sets, steps, effort
  hits) and **ETC ~Nmin · ETA clock**. A **comparison line** (`findPlanExecutions`) shows the **most-recent** and
  **all-time-best** prior runs of the same plan (best by stored `finalScore.points`, else set count; either may be
  absent or the same run). Because step→exercise matching is by exercise (`stepLoggedSets`/`optionMatchesVar`),
  progress is **retroactive across a mid-workout plan change** — sets logged under the old plan count toward the new
  plan's matching steps automatically. Covered by `test/plandash.spec.mjs`.
- **Plan-aware picker (feat 112 + 115):** when a plan is active, the exercise picker shows its **incomplete steps as
  chips** (`renderPicker`); tapping one sets `modalState.planStepFilter` so `filterVariations()` returns **exactly
  that step's exercises** — the union of its options (`stepQualifyingVarSet`) — **overriding** the mega/sub/equip
  pills (a set no normal filter could produce). A "✕ all exercises" chip clears it. From the **dashboard**, tapping a
  `.plan-step` calls `openStepPicker(idx)` to open the same filtered picker (and seeds the suggested weight via
  `_planLoadCtx`). The filter clears on pick / modal close. Covered by `test/planpicker.spec.mjs`.
- **Log-Sets current-step indicator (feat 116):** the strength Log-Sets form now leads with a banner
  (`planStepIndicatorHtml`) naming the plan step the current exercise belongs to (`planStepForVar` — earliest
  incomplete matching step), its **sets logged/target with a progress bar**, and whether the **effort is on target**
  (`stepEffort`). Off-plan exercises get a muted "not part of any plan step" note. Covered by `test/logstep.spec.mjs`.
- **Plan-complete popup + post-save picker routing (feat 113 + 114):** when the plan finishes, the card shows a
  **🎉 complete banner** (End / Summary) and `showPlanCompleteDialog()` pops a summary (steps, sets, effort, time, vs
  best) offering **End workout / Keep training**. And `saveSets` no longer drops you on the dashboard after a save —
  it routes to the **exercise picker** instead: blank/unfiltered with no plan, or **pre-filtered to the earliest
  incomplete step** (`currentPlanStepIndex` → `planStepFilter`, seeding `_planLoadCtx`) with a plan. **Exception:** a
  save that *just completed* the plan (`planExecutionSummary().complete` flips false→true) closes to the dashboard and
  fires the complete dialog. A new `endingWorkout` arg keeps the end-workout "save & end" path on its old close-to-
  dashboard behavior (the Save button calls `saveSets()` with no event arg). Covered by `test/postsave.spec.mjs`.
- **"All relevant trends" deep-link (feat 117):** a 📈 button on the **Reference** variation row and the **Log-Sets**
  form calls `openTrendsFor(varUuid, subUuid)` → sets `trendFocus`, switches to the Trends tab, and renders a focused
  view (`renderFocusedTrends`) with three cards from `buildFocusedTrends`: the exercise's **own subvariation** trend
  (`getSeriesForKey`), its **muscle** trend (body-part `bp`-grouped), and its **muscle-group** trend (mega-category
  grouped) — each via the existing `computeTrend`/`renderTrendCard`. A "← All trends" button clears the focus.
  Covered by `test/trendfocus.spec.mjs`.
- **Custom hi-res anatomy chart + OCR mapping (feat 118):** the glossary anatomy chart gains a **Simple** (built-in
  wireframe) vs **Detailed** view toggle. Uploading a hi-res labelled chart stores it in IndexedDB
  (`bioIdb*` 'anatomyChartImage'), unlocks + defaults to **Detailed**, and renders the image with clickable **tap
  hotspots** (each → `openGlossaryTo`). The hotspot map (`state.anatomyChart.map`, normalized 0..1 coords keyed to
  glossary terms) is produced offline by a new **desktop helper `tools/anatomy-ocr.py`** (Tesseract + OpenCV) that
  OCRs English labels, follows each leader line to its muscle, and emits a JSON map you import in-app — keeping the
  app single-file/offline (no bundled OCR engine). `renderAnatomyChart` was extended with the view toggle +
  upload/import/remove; `anatomyImportMap` validates + clamps the map. Covered by `test/anatomy.spec.mjs` (app) and
  `check.mjs` py_compile (tool). *(Approach chosen by the user: desktop helper over a multi-MB in-app WASM OCR.)*
- **Collapsible plan card (feat 127):** the active-workout plan card (`renderPlanGuide`) folds down to just its
  name + progress line. Tapping `.plan-card-head` (keyboard-operable, `role=button`) toggles
  `state.dashboard.planCollapsed` (persisted; a chevron flips ▾/▸) and re-renders; the bulky `.plan-card-body`
  (meta, comparison, steps, complete-banner, actions) gets the `hidden` attribute while the glanceable progress
  line stays visible. Covered by `test/plandash.spec.mjs`.
- **More mobility content (feat 128):** 24 new bodyweight movements drawn from yoga, pilates, tai chi and martial
  arts — 7 **dynamic** (Sun Salutation flow, Tai Chi Cloud Hands, Cossack flow, Pilates roll-up, shoulder
  pass-throughs, Frankenstein walks, Spiderman lunge) added to `mobility-warmup`; 8 **static** stretches (down dog,
  cobra/up-dog, seated fold, lizard, frog, seated twist, cow-face arms, standing side-bend) added to
  `static-stretch`; and a brand-new **Isometric Holds** family (`iso-poses`) with 9 held poses (chair, warrior II,
  boat, tree, horse stance/Mabu, Zhan Zhuang standing post, goddess, bridge, locust). Like every exercise these are
  hand-maintained in **both** representations — the detailed `exercises` array (drives the Reference panel's
  setup/movement/mistakes/programming) and the lean minified `FAMILIES` array (drives the picker / logging /
  `VAR_INDEX`) — plus a tier-map entry for the new family. Covered by `test/coaching.spec.mjs` (present + indexed in
  both, well-formed).
- **Per-category export + data summary (feat 129 / 130):** the Data Management page gains a **"By category"** block
  driven by one registry, `dataCats()` — Workouts, Body composition, Sleep, Strava, Plans, Exercise media, Custom
  variations, Settings. Each row shows the **count + date range** (`dataCatRange`) and offers export as **app-readable
  JSON** (a state slice — `{sessions,…}` for workouts, or a settings-type slice stamped with a fresh `savedAt` so
  `applyImport` merge re-adopts it) or a **human-readable CSV** (`csvWorkouts` one-row-per-set incl. cardio +
  e1RM, `csvBodyComp`, `csvSleep`, `csvStrava`, `csvPlans`; map-shaped categories are JSON-only). `exportCategoryJson`
  / `exportCategoryCsv` download a `gymtracker-<key>_<ts>.(json|csv)`; the table is built by `dataCategoryTableHtml`
  and rides along into the relocated Data page. Covered by `test/dataexport.spec.mjs` (counts/ranges, slice shapes,
  CSV rows, JSON re-import round-trip, rendered buttons).
- **Centered modal close button (feat 131):** `.media-head .media-close` (the ✕ on the media carousel and the Strava
  reconciliation modal) was a fixed 30×30 box with no flex centering, so the glyph sat low/off-center. Added
  `display:inline-flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center; line-height:1; padding:0`. An audit of the other
  ✕/× controls found this was the only fixed-square one missing centering (the picker clear button was already
  flex-centered; the rest are padding-sized). Covered by `test/mediawizard.spec.mjs` (computed-style centering).
- **Defensive OAuth origin allowlist (feat 132):** the committed public OAuth client ids (`SYNC_CLIENTS`) are
  gated app-side to an `OAUTH_ORIGINS` allowlist (`https://adervec.github.io` + localhost via a hostname check).
  `cloudOriginAllowed(origin)` (pure, parses `new URL(origin).hostname`, arg-overridable for tests) backs three
  gates: `cloudConnect` refuses `kind:'oauth'` providers on an unlisted origin (custom endpoint exempt);
  `cloudSyncCardHtml` disables the OAuth buttons + shows a note when the origin isn't allowed; and
  `cloudOAuthHandleRedirect` won't complete a token exchange off-origin. Defense-in-depth only — the providers
  already enforce their *Authorized JavaScript origins* server-side — but it makes a **fork of this public repo**
  fail fast (clear message, no leaked consent screen / quota use) instead of relying solely on Google's rejection.
  Data isolation was never at risk: each user authenticates as themselves and their data lives in their own Drive
  `appDataFolder`; the owner can't see others' data. Covered by `test/sync.spec.mjs` (allowlist logic + enabled/
  disabled button render); existing connect tests stay green since the test origin (`127.0.0.1`) is allowlisted.
- **PDF export of a data-review view (feat 133):** a **📄 PDF** button in the tracker header (shown only on the
  History / Volume / Trends tabs via `render()`) exports the current view. `exportCurrentViewPdf()` clones
  `#trk-main`'s HTML into a body-level `#print-root` with a titled header (`currentViewLabel()` → view + sub-context:
  e.g. *Volume · Group · Last week*, the History range, or the focused-Trends exercise) and calls the native
  `window.print()` — no library, so the app stays single-file/offline. The charts are inline **SVG** so they clone
  faithfully; an `@media print` block hides all chrome (`body.printing > *:not(#print-root)`), drops interactive
  controls (`.sub-tabs`/buttons/inputs), and sets `print-color-adjust: exact` so the dark theme + chart colours
  render. "Save or share" is the browser's print sheet (Save as PDF on desktop; Save/Share on Android). `afterprint`
  (+ a timeout fallback for mobile) clears `#print-root` and the `printing` class. Covered by `test/pdfexport.spec.mjs`
  (button visibility per tab, label/sub-context, clone-into-#print-root with header).
- **Promote Cloud Sync, archive File-System auto-save (feat 134):** the legacy desktop-only Auto-Save + Auto-Load
  sections on the Data Management page are wrapped in a collapsed `<details class="drawer-archived">` ("Legacy file
  auto-save / load — use ☁ Cloud Sync instead"; auto-opens if either is currently enabled) so Cloud Sync is the
  default cross-device path. The functions are untouched. Separately, the **Settings (⚙) long-press** is repointed
  from `openSettingsToLastChanged` to **`openDataPage`** — hold the gear to jump straight to Data Management.
  Covered by `test/dataexport.spec.mjs`.
- **Per-gym equipment stables + pin slider (feat 135):** each gym can now stock its own dumbbell / kettlebell /
  med-ball sizes and pin stack, edited in a collapsible **Equipment stable** block in the gym editor
  (`renderGymStableEditor` / `ensureGymStable`, stored on `gym.stable = { unit, db[], kb[], ball[], pin{first,inc,max} }`
  — tagged with the unit so cross-unit numbers are never misread). The setup tool's size lists resolve from the
  **active** gym (`activeStable()`), falling back to typical commercial defaults (`defaultDbSizes` 5,7.5,…,120 lb,
  `defaultKbSizes`, `defaultBallSizes`, `defaultPinStable`). The **pin stack** is reshaped to a first-step + main
  increment + max model: the default is *+5 then +10 up to 295 lb* (`pinStep()` — pure, testable — walks
  0→first→+inc≤max and back), and the **main increment is now a range slider** (`data-…-pininc`) instead of pills,
  with the add-on *Toppers* unchanged. Pin profiles persist `{inc, first, max}` (old `{inc}`-only profiles still
  load via fallbacks). Covered by `test/gymstable.spec.mjs` (defaults, `pinStep`, active-gym resolution incl.
  wrong-unit ignore, pin default state, slider render, gym-editor render + `parseSizeList`/`ensureGymStable`).
- **"Needs a spotter" flag (feat 136):** a discrete amber **🦺 spot** badge on the exercises where a free-weight
  barbell can pin/trap you at failure. `spotterMatch(v, fam)` is a precision-biased heuristic (reads only `.title`/
  `.id`, so it works on either the `exercises` or `FAMILIES` representation): it flags the bench/chest-press and
  squat families plus `back squat`/`skullcrusher` by name, then subtracts everything guarded or self-rescuable
  (smith, machine, fixed, cable, dumbbell, kettlebell, band, floor press, hack, goblet, belt/landmine, front/split/
  overhead/bodyweight squats, …). It lands on ~26 of 816 variations — all genuine barbell bench presses + loaded
  back/front squats + skullcrusher. The badge (`spotterBadge`) renders in the **exercise picker** rows and the
  **Reference** variation rows; `needsSpotter(uuid)` is the VAR_INDEX wrapper. Covered by `test/spotter.spec.mjs`
  (flag/no-flag sets, precision-count sanity, badge render, picker render).
- **Live plan progress for unsaved sets (feat 137):** the plan-progress dashboard was counting only *saved* sets,
  so the sets you were mid-entering didn't show — misleading. `stepLoggedSets` / `stepTopWeight` now fold in the
  **unsaved `pending` sets** (`pendingStepSets`) — but only for the **live** session (`session === getActiveSession()`),
  never while **editing** a saved exercise (those rows already exist → double-count), and only rows with a weight.
  Discarding the log (Clear / pick another exercise / end-and-discard) empties `pending` → the progress reverts.
  Closing the modal (✕/footer/backdrop/Esc) now re-`render()`s the dashboard so it reflects (or drops) the pending
  sets. A `_planIgnorePending` guard keeps `saveSets`' "was the plan already complete *before* this save?" snapshot
  on saved-only counts (else the plan-complete popup wouldn't fire). Covered by `test/plandash.spec.mjs`.
- **Tap plan progress → full plan (feat 138):** the progress line on the workout dashboard is now a button
  (`#plan-progress-open`, keyboard-operable, with a `›` affordance) that opens the active plan in the full plans
  overlay via a new `openPlanFull(id)` (sets `_plansEditId` → `renderPlanEditor`, showing every step). Distinct from
  the card header, which still toggles collapse (feat 127). Covered by `test/plandash.spec.mjs`.
- **Notched current-step HUD bar (feat 139):** the current-step progress bar moved out of the log form into a global
  `#plan-step-bar` strip docked **directly below the rest-timer bar** (a fixed HUD; its `top` and the `.panel`
  padding stack under the rest bar via `rest-bar-on`/`-idle` × `plan-step-bar-on` body classes; z-index 9997 so it,
  like the rest bar, floats over the log modal). The bar is **notched** — one segment per target set: saved sets
  solid (`.filled`), unsaved pending sets dimmed (`.pending`, feat 137), green when the step is done.
  `refreshPlanStepBar()` runs on every `refreshRestBar()` path; it picks the step you're logging (`pending.varUuid`)
  else the earliest incomplete (`currentPlanStepIndex`), and hides outside a planned workout / when complete. Tapping
  it opens the full plan (feat 138). The old in-form `planStepIndicatorHtml` is removed from the form (function kept).
  Covered by `test/stepbar.spec.mjs`; visually verified via a `page.pdf`/screenshot pass.
- **Headphone-only mute no longer mutes Bluetooth headsets (feat 140):** the speaker/headphone detector
  (`probeAudioOutput`) classified an output as headphones only when its label matched a keyword regex, so a Bluetooth
  headset shown by **brand name** ("Sony WH-1000XM4", "Bose QC35", "Galaxy Buds") matched nothing and — combined with
  the old `.some()` reducer — collapsed to `false` (speaker only) → audio wrongly muted. The classifier is now a pure,
  three-way `classifyAudioOutputs(labels)`: **headphones (`true`)** if any output positively reads as a headphone
  (`_HEADPHONE_RE`, now also `\bbt\b`/`hands-free`/`hfp`, and never a `_SPEAKER_RE` match); **speaker-only (`false`)**
  only when **every** labeled output positively reads as the built-in speaker/earpiece; **unknown (`null`, fail open)**
  for anything else — so an unrecognized non-speaker output (a brand-name BT headset) keeps audio playing instead of
  silently muting. Faithful to the feature's stated fail-open design. Covered by `test/headphones.spec.mjs`.
- **OSK ×10 digit hold is weight-only (feat 141):** the on-screen-keyboard digit long-press (hold `7` from an empty
  field → `70`, feat 100) now arms **only on the weight field**. `numpadDigitX10Eligible()` gained a `np.field === 'w'`
  guard, so the reps numpad treats a hold as a plain tap and never shows the `×10` affordance. Reps are typically small
  literal counts (1–20) where the shortcut mostly produced fat-finger 5→50 mistakes; weights are the multiples-of-10
  case it was built for. Covered by `test/numpad.spec.mjs` (weight x10 retained, reps hold inert + no label).
- **Long-press Copy → copy previous reps (feat 142):** the footer **Copy** button gains a second gesture. A **tap**
  still copies the weight to the next set (`copyWeightToNextSet`, feat 58); a **hold** runs a new
  `copyRepsToOpenSet()` that fills the **open set**'s still-empty reps (`isSetOpen` = weight in, reps not) with the
  **previous rep count** — the nearest earlier pending set that has reps, else the last logged set in history for the
  exercise — so an identical-reps scheme (e.g. 3×8) logs in one gesture. It reuses `commitSetField(i,'r',…)` (parse,
  `ts` stamp, persist, live-update) and is a no-op with a toast when there's no open set or no prior reps
  ("applicable"). Wired via `attachTopbarLongPress` **once at init** (the footer button is static) so the long-press
  and its click-swallower don't stack across modal re-renders; the button `title` now documents tap-vs-hold. Covered
  by `test/copyreps.spec.mjs` (prior-pending source, history fallback, no-op guards, end-to-end tap-vs-hold).
- **Setup-picker ×N remove is its own button (feat 143):** in the equipment setup tools (Barbell / Plate / Landmine
  plate grids + the Pin **toppers**), the per-plate count was a tiny `<span class="setup-ct">×N</span>` **nested inside**
  the add pill — a finicky, fat-finger-prone remove target that often added instead. Each weight is now a
  `.setup-pill-grp` **segmented control**: the add pill (`data-…-padd` / `-topper`) plus, only when a plate is on, a
  **separate** `.setup-ct-btn` remove button (`data-…-psub` / `-toppersub`, accent, turns danger-red on press) joined
  to its right. Two distinct, full-height tap targets — tap the pill to add, tap **×N** to remove one — with no
  handler changes (same data-attributes). Covered by `test/setuppills.spec.mjs` (×N is a sibling BUTTON not nested,
  add/remove counts, ×N hidden at zero); visually verified via a barbell-setup screenshot.
- **Per-step minimum completion % (feat 144):** a step now counts as "done" once it reaches a **minimum % of its
  target sets**, not necessarily all of them. The threshold resolves **per-step (`step.minPct`) → per-plan
  (`plan.minPct`) → global default (`state.planDefaults.minPct`, default 1%)** via `resolveStepMinPct`; `stepMinSets`
  = `ceil(target × %)` with a floor of 1 (so the 1% default = "even 1 set counts the step as done"). `stepStatus`
  now returns **`done`** (full target met — *pending-inclusive*, drives the current-step pointer + the step HUD bar,
  unchanged) **and `satisfied`** (the min-% threshold met by **SAVED sets only**). The split is deliberate: the min-%
  is *checked after a save, never on the live pending set*, and the pointer keeps using the full target — so
  **following the plan exactly never ends a step prematurely** (you keep working a step until its full sets even
  though 1 saved set already "satisfied" it). `planExecutionSummary` exposes `stepsDone` (satisfied count) +
  `stepsFull` (full-target count); **`complete` (the 🎉 banner / plan-complete popup) fires on min-% satisfied**. The
  dashboard shows "N/Y steps (M full)", a per-step "· min ✓" marker, and keeps the satisfied-but-incomplete current
  step highlighted; the history badge reads "✓ full" / "✓ done" / "partial". Editable via a **Workout Session →
  Plan step min completion** default and per-plan / per-step inputs in the plan editor (blank inherits). Covered by
  `test/minpct.spec.mjs` (resolution, saved-only-after-save vs pending, no premature pointer advance, complete at
  min%, 100% override, editor persistence, persisted default); visually verified (editor + dashboard).
- **Plan Execution View (feat 145):** a detailed drill-down (richer than the dashboard plan card) that shows, per
  step, **which variation(s) were actually logged to "satisfy" it** — the key ask. `renderPlanExecutionView(body,
  plan, session)` renders into the plans overlay (new `_plansExecId` / `_plansExecSessionDate` mode in
  `renderPlansOverlay`): a header + roll-up (`stepsDone/total (M full)`, sets, effort, complete 🎉), then each step
  with a status chip (**✓ full / ✓ min (≥k/n) / ▶ in progress / … partial / ○ not done**, following feat 144's
  satisfied-vs-done split) and a **"Satisfied by"** block listing every matching logged exercise — variation name (+
  spotter badge), the sets (`135×5 · 135×5 · 140×4`), top weight and est 1RM, plus the planned options, load and
  effort. Opened from a new **📊 Execution** button on the dashboard plan card (active session) and from **any
  session's plan badge** (now clickable, wired once via a delegated `[data-plan-exec-sess]` handler so it works in
  history too). Status classes are namespaced (`pe-full`/`pe-min`/…) to avoid the global `.full{}` collision. Covered
  by `test/planexec.spec.mjs` (variations + sets + statuses, roll-up + back, history-badge entry); visually verified.
- **Dashboard (today) vs Log (paginated history) split (feat 146):** the default tab — internally still `log` (keeps
  the FAB + workout controls) — is **renamed "Dashboard"** and is now **today-only** (its old "Recent Sessions" +
  "All-Time" blocks were removed; an unobtrusive `#dash-see-log` link points to the Log). A **new "Log" tab**
  (`data-tab="sessions"` → `renderSessionsLog`) lists **every** session newest-first with an all-time summary
  (sessions, total sets, date range) and **pagination** (`SESSIONS_PER_PAGE = 10`, `_sessionsLogPage`, ← Newer /
  Older →) so a long history isn't dumped at once. The per-session card interactions (edit / superset / HR / share /
  notes) were extracted into a shared `bindSessionCards(main)` used by both tabs, and tab switching is centralised in
  a `switchToTab(name)` helper (resets the page + history/volume sub-state). "History" stays a separate filtered/
  searchable view. Covered by `test/sessionslog.spec.mjs` (tab labels, today-only Dashboard, pagination math + nav,
  single-page no-pager, see-Log link); visually verified.
- **Categorized, searchable, filterable plan picker (feat 147):** the plans overlay list (`renderPlansList`) gains a
  **search box** (name/theme), **category** filter chips and **length** filter chips, with plans **grouped under
  category headers**. Categories are *derived* (`planCategory` → Push / Pull / Legs / Upper / Full Body / Core /
  Mixed / Mobility / …) from each plan's step **muscle-mega mix** (`planMegaDist`, mirroring `sessionSplitLabel`), so
  no hand-maintained field is needed and user plans categorize automatically; length buckets (quick ≤40 / standard /
  long ≥90 min) come from `estimatePlanMinutes`. Filters live in `_plansSearch` / `_plansCatFilter` /
  `_plansLenFilter` (reset on overlay open), the search keeps focus + caret across re-render, an empty result shows a
  **Clear filters** action, and each row carries a category tag. `PLAN_CAT_ORDER` ranks the chips + headers. Covered
  by `test/planlist.spec.mjs` (category derivation, chips + grouped headers, search, category filter, length filter +
  clear); visually verified on the real seed plans.
- **Rest/plan-step bar no longer overlaps the log sheet (feat 148):** the Log-Sets sheet (`#trk-modal`) is a
  full-screen fixed overlay at `top:0`, so the fixed top bar (z9999) + the rest-timer bar (z9998) + the plan-step HUD
  bar (z9997) floated **over** its top content — clipping the exercise title and the first sets. The sheet now gets
  body-class-driven `top` offsets mirroring the `.panel` rules (`top:48px` base for the top bar → `78`/`102`/`90`/…
  as the rest/idle + plan-step bars show), so it always starts just below whichever bars are visible. Bonus: the
  modal's own "Log Sets" header (previously hidden behind the top bar) is now visible. Covered by
  `test/restbaroverlap.spec.mjs`; visually verified.
- **Set/reps field flashes on value change (feat 149):** when a set input's value changes for any reason, the field
  briefly flashes. `commitSetField` (the single chokepoint for typing, OSK writes, and copy-reps) now calls a new
  `flashSetField(i,f)` when the value actually changed (skipped when unchanged); `copyRepsToOpenSet` re-flashes after
  its `renderModal`. The flash is an animated **box-shadow ring** (`@keyframes field-flash`), not a border-color —
  `.set-input` has `border-color … !important` which would beat an animated border, whereas the ring is free. The
  animation restarts each call (reflow trick) so rapid edits hold a steady glow then fade. Covered by
  `test/fieldflash.spec.mjs` (changed flashes, unchanged doesn't, input-event path, copy-reps path).
- **OSK on by default + strongly recommended (feat 150):** the on-screen numpad was effectively **off** by default —
  the initial `DEFAULTS.workoutControls.onScreenNumpad` was `false` and won the `normalizeState` merge over the (true)
  default. Set it `true` in `DEFAULTS` + the `ensureWC` fallback so fresh installs default-on; explicit user "off" is
  still respected (no force-migration). The settings toggle now carries a **★ Recommended** badge, a **"Strongly
  recommended — keep this on"** hint (noting the OSK powers ×10-hold, the calculator, plate setup + equipment tools),
  and an "On ★" pill. Covered by `test/oskdefault.spec.mjs` (fresh-install default, recommendation UI, explicit-off
  respected).
- **Confirm change-exercise with 2+ unsaved sets (feat 151):** the Log-Sets "🔄 Change exercise" button now counts
  the entered (weight-filled) sets; with **≥2** it pops a themed `confirmDialog` ("…N sets … aren't saved yet.
  Picking a different exercise will discard them.") before switching to the picker — picking a different exercise
  discards the in-progress sets, so this guards real work. <2 sets (or a blank trailing row) proceeds straight
  through, and editing a saved exercise is exempt. Covered by `test/changeexconfirm.spec.mjs` (confirm→proceed,
  cancel→stay, single-set bypass, blank-row not counted).
- **Step bar opens the execution view (feat 156):** the notched current-step HUD bar (`#plan-step-bar`) now opens the
  detailed **Plan Execution View** (feat 145, `openPlanExecution`) instead of the plan editor (`openPlanFull`); title
  updated. Covered by `test/planexec.spec.mjs`.
- **Discard active workout (feat 154):** a new **🗑 Discard** button in the active-workout controls (next to End
  Workout) runs `discardActiveWorkout()` — a themed `confirmDialog` (showing the set count, "as if the session never
  happened, can't be undone") then `clearPending()` + `stopMetronome()` + **`tombstoneSession()`** (feat 95, so sync
  won't resurrect it) + removes the session from `state.sessions`. Distinct from End Workout, which keeps and grades
  the session. Covered by `test/discardworkout.spec.mjs` (confirm removes+tombstones, cancel keeps, button renders).
- **Data-op progress popup + missing-UUID resilience (feat 152/153):** every commanded data operation now runs inside
  `runDataOp(title, fn)` — a popup that shows progress (spinner), then a **✓ success** (auto-dismisses after 1.3s when
  clean) or a **✕ failure with a human-readable explanation** (`humanizeDataError` maps JSON-parse / quota / network /
  permission / not-a-backup errors). `fn(ctx)` runs **synchronously** so a `downloadBlob` stays inside the click
  gesture, but may return a Promise for async work; `ctx.warn(msg)` collects non-fatal warnings. Wired through
  `exportData`, `exportCategoryJson/Csv`, and the import parse + apply. **feat 153:** `missingVarReport` /
  `missingVarWarning` detect sessions/plans referencing a variation UUID this build doesn't know (e.g. a custom
  exercise changed by an update); the op **warns but never fails** and the rows are **kept with their original IDs**
  (export) / **merged anyway** (import) so nothing is silently dropped. Covered by `test/dataop.spec.mjs` (error
  mapping, failure popup, missing-UUID report + warning, export warns-not-fails, clean success, resilient import);
  visually verified.
- **Step suggestion = loose weight×reps, tuned to the variation (feat 161):** the plan-step load badge suggested only
  a weight, and for a *movement* option it used the family-wide **max** baseline — over-suggesting from your single
  heaviest variation. `baselineWeightForOption` now tunes a movement to the **most-recently-trained** variation in the
  family, and a new `suggestedSetForOption(o, load)` returns a **weight×reps** suggestion (`repTargetForLoad`: heavy 5
  / moderate 8 / light 12; weight scaled from your recent baseline, or `null` → suggest reps only when there's no
  history). The badge reads "load · suggest ≈ {w}×{r}" with a "just a guide, not a target" tooltip. Covered by
  `test/stepsuggest.spec.mjs` (rep targets, tuned weight, movement→most-recent-not-max, no-history reps-only, render).
- **Grades: S top, D floor, ≥ filter (feat 158):** the grade scale now tops out at **S** (replacing A+) and floors at
  **D** (no F, for positivity) via a single `GRADE_SCALE` source of truth — `gradeFor`, `computeWorkoutScore`, and the
  live-score estimate all use it. New `GRADE_ORDER`/`gradeRank` (legacy `A+`→A, `F`→D-floor) power a **Grade ≥** chip
  filter on the **Log** tab (`_logMinGrade`) that narrows the session list to a chosen grade or better, with an
  empty-state + "show all". A gold **`.g-S`** chip style marks the top tier. Covered by `test/grades.spec.mjs` (scale,
  ranking + legacy, Log ≥-filter, S chip).
- **Wake lock during a workout (feat 160):** the honest answer to "PWA can't play audio/haptics unless open+unlocked"
  — a web app genuinely can't fire them when the screen is **locked** or the app is closed (OS restriction). So we
  hold a **Screen Wake Lock** while a workout is active (`acquireWakeLock`/`releaseWakeLock`/`refreshWakeLock`,
  gated by `wakeLockSupported()` + the default-on `workoutControls.keepAwake` + an active session), keeping the
  display on so the metronome / rest cues keep playing. Acquired on `startWorkout`, released on end/discard,
  re-acquired on `visibilitychange` (locks drop when hidden) + at boot. A **Keep screen awake during workout**
  settings toggle states the limitation plainly. Covered by `test/wakelock.spec.mjs` (acquire/release, setting + no-
  session gates, settings UI).
- **Live score: real value + autoscaled sparkline (feat 157):** the live estimate was rounded to the nearest 5
  (`Math.round(pts/5)*5`), so it "stuck" to round numbers. It now shows the **real integer** score (no faked
  volatility — just stop hiding the real moves), tracks it across the session (`trackLiveScore`, de-duped + reset per
  session, ephemeral) and draws an **autoscaled sparkline** (`sparklineSvg`, y mapped to the series min/max so small
  real changes are visible) plus a "▲/▼ N this session" delta. `sparklineSvg` is a reusable helper for other live
  trends. Covered by `test/livescore.spec.mjs` (sample tracking, autoscale + flat/short series, no-rounding code path).
- **HR connection robustness across app open/close (feat 159):** the Web-Bluetooth HR link dropped when the app was
  backgrounded/closed and nothing re-attached on return. The foreground-return path (`visibilitychange`→visible +
  `window 'focus'`) now silently re-attaches the remembered device via `hrTryReconnect()` (the existing
  `getDevices()` reconnect), and a boot-time reconnect attempt covers a full reopen mid-workout. The
  `gattserverdisconnected` retry (`hrScheduleReconnect`) now fires **immediately** instead of waiting the first 6s and
  persists longer (30 tries). Covered by `test/hrreconnect.spec.mjs` (silent re-attach, no-op guards, wiring present).
- **Exclude muscle groups from the overall trend (feat 165):** the Overall Progress Index can now omit chosen muscle
  groups (e.g. an injured area unfairly dragging the average). `computeOverallProgress` filters tracking keys whose
  `bp` is in the persisted `state.trendExclude`; the Overall trend view shows tap-to-exclude muscle-group chips and —
  when any are excluded — a **loud reminder banner** ("⚠️ excluding Chest — restore once recovered") with a one-tap
  **Restore all**, plus a "filtered" tag + warn-bordered card so it's never forgotten. Covered by
  `test/trendexclude.spec.mjs` (exclusion drops exercises, toggle on/off, banner+chips render, persisted setting).
- **New plan from a past freestyle workout (feat 155):** the plans list gains a **＋ From a past workout** button
  (shown when `_freestyleSessions()` — plan-less sessions with strength sets — exist). It pops a `choiceDialog` of the
  10 most recent freestyle sessions; picking one runs `newPlanFromSession()` which builds a plan with **one step per
  logged strength exercise** (sets = sets logged, the variation as the step option, named "&lt;split&gt; · &lt;date&gt;",
  `createdFromSession` recorded) and opens it in the editor to tweak. Covered by `test/planfromworkout.spec.mjs`
  (step-per-exercise + cardio skip, freestyle filtering, button shown/hidden).
- **GymTracker315 branding (feat 170):** the tracker header is now a generic **GymTracker315** wordmark (stylized
  text placeholder — "Gym" + accent "Tracker" + a "315" badge; not trademarked/copyrighted) instead of "📈 Overload
  Tracker". A **Preferences → Show GymTracker315 branding** toggle (`state.hideBranding`) hides it via a `brand-hidden`
  body class (`applyBranding()` on every render). **Exports always carry the brand regardless:** `brandLogoHtml(true)`
  heads the PDF print-root, and the share-image card draws "GymTracker315" at the top of the header band (and keeps
  its footer credit). Covered by `test/branding.spec.mjs` (header wordmark, hide toggle, PDF brand-while-hidden,
  persisted setting); visually verified.
- **Time-bounded "Copy for Claude" digest (feat 171):** the most efficient way to hand a progress summary to Claude —
  a **compact markdown digest** (`buildClaudeDigest`) built over the export dialog's existing time window
  (week/month/last30/all/custom). It **aggregates per exercise** (not every raw set, so it fits one message): an
  explicit analysis ask, an overview (sessions, span, /week, sets, avg grade), per-exercise **e1RM progression**
  (first→latest top set + % change + best, capped at 30 with an overflow note), and body/cardio notes. Surfaced as a
  **🤖 Copy summary for Claude** button in the export dialog. Covered by `test/claudeexport.spec.mjs` (digest shape +
  progression + body, exercise cap, button present).
- **Illicit-drug / illegal-activity sweep (feat 172):** swept the app's text for anything that could read as
  encouraging illicit drug use or illegal activity. The glossary's PED/steroid "slang" entries are **kept for
  awareness but neutralized** — removed the glamorizing drug-stacking meme ("Tren hard, eat clen, anavar give up"),
  added explicit **health + "illegal without a prescription"** caveats and a **not-recommended / natural, drug-free
  training** framing to Sauce/Juice, PEDs, TRT, Roid Rage, Tren, Roid, Natty; reframed caffeine's "Legal PED" label to
  "Everyday boost". Alcohol mentions were all already cautionary (sleep/recovery) or benign sport tradition — left as
  is. Covered by `test/contentsweep.spec.mjs`.
- **More seed plans (feat 168):** added a 4th tranche of 10 plans across varied flavours — **5×5 Strength A/B**
  (classic linear progression), **Calisthenics Foundations** (bodyweight), **Posterior Strength** (hinge-led), **Arm
  Day**, **Core & Midsection**, **Lunch Break 20** (quick), **Chest Specialization**, **Shoulder Sculpt**, **Back &
  Biceps** — all using already-valid movement family ids, so they categorize/search/filter via the feat 147 picker.
  Copy kept clean per the feat 173 sweep. Covered by `test/moreplans.spec.mjs` (new plans present, **every** seed
  plan's options resolve to real movements/variations, categories spread).
- **Achievement paths (feat 169):** a new **🏅 Milestones** sub-view in the Trends tab with ladders of classic,
  challenging-but-realistic goals: plate-count **Bench / Squat / Deadlift** (135→405/495/585), the **Captains of
  Crush** grip ladder (self-tracked), and **Running / Rowing distance** (5K→marathon, 2K→half). `ACHIEVEMENT_PATHS`
  + `computeAchievement` read progress from your **own logged best** — *not strict on variation or powerlifting aids*
  (any bench counts toward "X plates"; strength compared in lb, cardio in km). Each card shows reached tier, next
  target ("85 lb to 3 plates"), a tier ladder, and a **per-path safety note**; the view opens with a prominent
  **disclaimer discouraging dangerous behaviour** (heavy unspotted bench, overly long runs). Covered by
  `test/achievements.spec.mjs` (tier from best lift, cardio distance, disclaimer + notes + all paths, tab view);
  visually verified.
- **Reconcile duplicate movements (feat 166):** "Neck Training" and "Resistance Band Work" each existed as **two**
  families across the base + extra datasets (and in both the picker and the Reference). A load-time `dedupeFamilies()`
  now collapses same-title families into one canonical (`_dedupeMovementList` over **both** `FAMILIES` — re-pointing
  `VAR_INDEX` so logged sets still resolve — and the Reference `exercises`). Canonical preference: a feat-90 EXTRA id
  wins, then more variations, then first-seen — so `neck-training` (the expected canonical) beats the legacy `neck`,
  and the richer `resistance-bands` (15 vars) beats `band-work` (7); distinct variations are unioned. Dropped family
  ids are kept resolvable via `_FAMILY_ALIAS` + `resolveFamilyId` (used in `optionMatchesVar`) so a plan's movement
  option still matches. Covered by `test/dedupfamilies.spec.mjs` (no dup titles, variations resolve, alias matching).
- **Variation cross-listing — primary + secondary parents (feat 167):** beyond duplicate *families* (feat 166), the
  datasets carried ~25 cases of the **same exercise filed under two different movements** (the canonical example:
  **Plate Pinch** under both *Grip Training* and *Forearm Work*; also Landmine Press, Meadows Row, Muscle-Up, Wall
  Ball, Anderson Squat, Dragon Flag, …). A variation now has exactly **one primary parent** (the family it lives in)
  and may be **cross-listed** under additional **secondary parent** movements, where it renders at the **bottom** of
  that family's picker list with a *"↳ primarily a &lt;movement&gt;"* link that jumps to its home movement. A plan
  **movement-step is satisfied by a variation whether the movement is its primary OR a secondary parent** —
  `optionMatchesVar` and `stepQualifyingVarSet` both honour `secondaryParentsOf()` / `secondaryVarsForFamily()`.
  Authored as `VAR_DUP_RECONCILE` `{keep, drop}` uuid pairs: `keep` is the canonical/primary; `drop` is the duplicate
  copy, which `reconcileVariationParents()` (run at load after `dedupeFamilies()`) **suppresses** from its own
  family's list (`_VAR_SUPPRESS` → `varVisibleInPicker`) and whose family becomes a **secondary parent of the
  canonical**. Net: the exercise shows **once per family** (never a stale twin), yet both movement steps still match
  it. No logged data is destroyed — suppressed copies stay in `VAR_INDEX` (old sessions resolve + render) and still
  natively satisfy their own family's steps. Primary picks are editorial (the more natural "home"); the relationship
  is plain data, trivially re-pointed, with a `SECONDARY_PARENTS_EXTRA` hook for purely-additive cross-listings.
  Covered by `test/secondaryparents.spec.mjs` (primary+secondary matching, qualifying-set union, suppression + the
  cross-link row, no remaining visible cross-family dups, data preserved); `test/planpicker.spec.mjs` updated for the
  union semantics.
- **Claude-fillable media reference sheet (feat 174):** the bulk-media tools previously only spoke JSON — `Export
  exercise list` emitted machine JSON for the python matcher, and `Import media map` consumed a *different* JSON
  shape. New **round-trip** path so a human (or **Claude chat / cowork**) can populate reference clips: **`📝 Media
  sheet`** (`buildMediaSheet(scope)`) exports a plain-markdown list of every exercise — grouped by movement, each line
  carrying a stable `{id: <uuid>}` tag and a `media:` slot pre-filled with any existing links — with fill-in
  instructions at the top; scope is **all** or **only those missing links**. You hand it to Claude ("find good form
  clips for each"), Claude fills the `media:` lines, and you re-import the **same text** — `parseMediaSheet()` reads
  each exercise block by its `{id}` tag (falling back to the **title** if the tag was dropped) and grabs every
  `http(s)` URL on the `media:` line *or* bare continuation lines, tolerant of light reformatting. Import is unified
  via **`importMediaData()`**, which sniffs the first char (`{`/`[` → JSON map, else → sheet), so the one **Import
  file** button (now also `.md`) and a new **`📋 Paste sheet to import`** (reads the clipboard) both accept either
  format. The JSON importer was refactored to share `applyMediaEntries()` (attach + dedup + match-by-uuid/id/title)
  with the sheet path, so matching/merging/reporting stay identical. The export also lands on the clipboard for an
  immediate paste into Claude. Covered by `test/mediasheet.spec.mjs` (sheet shape, export→wipe→import round-trip,
  parser tolerance + title fallback, JSON-or-sheet dispatch, missing-only scope, graceful unmatched handling).
- **Reference page — last of the 3‑panel‑switcher teardown (feat 191):** Study › Reference became a **router page**.
  Rather than rewrite the whole `renderRef` catalog (its own search / mega + equip filters / detailed·tree·table
  views), `#panel-reference` is now the **host panel for the reference page**: the panel‑surfacing was reworked so the
  active panel keys off `currentPage` — `_surfacePanelForPage()` (called from `renderCurrentPage`) shows
  `panel-reference` when `currentPage==='reference'` and `panel-tracker` otherwise (it `switchPanel`s directly to
  avoid recursing through the navTo shim). The old pre‑`currentPage` `_surfaceTracker()` calls were dropped from
  `navTo` / `navBack` / `navForward`, and `topbarBack` collapsed to a plain `navBack()` now that Reference is in the
  router history. Every entry point routes to the page: `goPanel('panel-reference')` → `navTo('reference')` (covers
  `openInReference`, `topbarReferenceCurrent`), plus `openReferenceFor(uuid)` and the hidden 📚 nav‑tab.
  `renderReferencePage` clears `#trk-main` (it's covered by the panel) and re‑runs `renderRef`. Covered by
  `test/refpage.spec.mjs`; the coaching / navtopbar crosslink + panel‑switcher tests stay green. With this, all three
  legacy slide‑ins (coaching, glossary, reference) are gone — `switchPanel` survives only as the thin surfacing
  primitive for `panel-tracker` ↔ `panel-reference`.
- **Glossary + Anatomy pages (feat 190):** Study › Glossary and Study › Anatomy became **router pages**, and the
  glossary slide‑in mode is retired — it always shows **full‑page** now (the user's "never a slide‑in / full page").
  The existing `#ref-gloss-panel` overlay machinery (search, category filters, term list, the feat‑30 anatomy chart +
  OCR hotspots) is reused verbatim: `_showGlossOverlay(chartOpen)` displays it (Glossary → list, Anatomy → chart pane
  open) and `renderGlossaryPage` / `renderAnatomyPage` are the leaf renderers. External entry points are now router
  shims — `openGloss()` → `navTo('glossary')`; `openGlossaryTo(term)` re‑renders in place when you're already on the
  page (an anatomy hotspot) else `navTo('glossary')`, so highlight‑to‑glossary, the Reference glossary button, the
  📖 long‑press, and the anatomy crosslinks all land on the page. The panel keeps its own header; its **✕ and Escape
  go Back through the router** (`navBack`), and `renderCurrentPage` calls `_syncGlossOverlay()` to auto‑hide it when
  you navigate away. (The panel still sits above the app top bar — a later cleanup can re‑home it below the bar for
  full chrome consistency.) Covered by `test/glosspage.spec.mjs`; `test/anatomy.spec.mjs` (which drives
  `renderAnatomyChart` directly) is unaffected.
- **Advice page — coaching out of the panel switcher (feat 189):** Study › Advice became a **router page**
  (`renderAdvicePage`) and the **`panel-coaching` slide‑in was retired** — the first dismantling of the legacy
  3‑panel switcher. The Coaching & Progression content (endurance / bouldering / grip cards + the bundled‑guide
  reader) renders into `#trk-main` by reusing `renderCoaching()` / `bindCoaching()` verbatim against
  `#coaching-content`. `goPanel('panel-coaching')` is now a shim → `navTo('advice')`, so every entry point flows to
  the page: the Reference panel's `.coach-banner`, the `topbarCoachingRelevant` long‑press (its scroll‑to‑relevant
  card still works), and the hidden 🧭 nav‑tab (rewired to `navTo('advice')`). The bundled‑guide reader
  (`#guide-reader`, body‑level) and the coaching↔Reference crosslinks are unchanged. `test/coaching.spec.mjs`
  updated: the five panel‑coaching cases now drive `navTo('advice')` and assert `currentPage==='advice'` /
  `#trk-main #coaching-content`. (Reference / Glossary / Anatomy follow in later phases.)
- **Contextual workout shortcuts (feat 188):** while a workout is active, the top bar grows a **third row** —
  🔥 Workout · ✍️ Exercise · 🏁 End — for one‑tap access from anywhere; it's hidden otherwise (the nav stays a pure
  hierarchy, the locked decision). Visibility is driven by `body.workout-active`, toggled by `updateWorkoutBar()`
  (called from `refreshRestBar`, which runs on every workout‑state change), and the row grows `--topbar-h` by 40px so
  every fixed offset (panel padding, rest/step bars, log sheet) keys off the taller bar automatically (122px, or 84px
  with the brand hidden — a two‑class selector wins by specificity). 🔥 → `navTo('workout')` (highlighted when
  there) · ✍️ → `navTo('exercise')` (the log‑sheet shim until the Exercise page lands) · 🏁 → the feat‑108
  `attachTrackerPress` (a tap confirms, a hold skips). The `#rest-bar` deep‑link was rewired from the legacy
  `switchPanel`+`currentTab` dance to a plain `navTo('workout')`. Covered by `test/workoutshortcuts.spec.mjs`
  (hidden↔shown + the 82→122px height, navigation + highlight, end hides it, rest‑bar deep‑link).
- **Settings split — Profile / Cosmetic / Preferences pages (feat 187):** the next slice of "everything its own
  page." The three leaves stopped opening the all‑in‑one drawer and became **router pages** that each relocate a
  *bucket* of the existing settings‑drawer sections (DOM nodes + their live bindings) into `#trk-main` — the same
  proven trick as the Data Management page (`#drawer-data-wrap`). A `SETTINGS_PAGE_SECS` map routes each `data-sec`
  section to a page: **Profile** = profile + biometrics · **Cosmetic** = theme + branding · **Preferences** =
  language, preferences, workout‑session, metronome, rest‑timer‑cues, live‑dashboard, categories, reference. The
  branding toggle was promoted from a row inside *Preferences* into its own **Branding** section so it lands under
  Cosmetic (themes/branding). `renderSettingsDrawer()`'s tail now calls `_relocateSettingsPage()`, so any toggle whose
  binding re‑renders the drawer (pref pills, theme swatches) refreshes the open page **in place**. The legacy drawer
  still exists for the ⚙️ long‑press + sound‑menu "More" entry points; the Gyms drawer section is intentionally not
  bucketed (gym management lives on the dedicated Gyms page). Covered by `test/settingspages.spec.mjs` (disjoint
  buckets, branding under Cosmetic, in‑place toggle refresh, legacy drawer intact). Data + the remaining drawer
  retire in a later phase.
- **Help page (feat 186):** Settings › Help became its own **router page** (`renderHelpPage`) — the same content as
  the ❓ quick-help overlay, now **searchable + collapsible** (the user asked for "up-to-date, searchable,
  collapsible"). `renderHelp()` gained an optional target id so the page reuses its exact copy verbatim (no
  duplication); `_decorateHelpCollapsible()` then groups each `<h3>` section into a `<details>`, and a sticky search
  box live-filters the sections (auto-expanding matches). The content styles were promoted from `#help-body` to a
  shared `.help-content` class so the overlay and the page render identically. The `set-help` leaf flips from
  `open:()=>openHelp()` to a `render` page; the top-bar ❓ overlay is left unchanged for quick access. Covered by a
  `test/legal.spec.mjs` case (sections present + collapsible, search narrows the visible list).
- **About page (feat 185):** Settings › About became its own **router page** (`renderAboutPage`) instead of a
  collapsible section buried in the settings drawer — the build stamp (`APP_BUILD`), the early-access notice, the
  designer / Claude-Code credit, and the **consolidated disclaimer / trademarks / MIT-licence** block (reusing the
  single `legalDisclaimerHtml()` source, now shown expanded in a card rather than behind a `<details>`). The
  `set-about` leaf flipped from `open:()=>openSettingsDrawer()` to a `render` page — the first slice of the Settings
  "everything its own page" split. `test/legal.spec.mjs` adds a case asserting the page carries the build + the
  disclaimer keys (no-advice / MIT / trademarks).
- **Plan Creator → page (feat 184):** the Workout Plans creator/list/editor moved out of the `#plans-panel`
  slide-in into the **router page `plan-creator`** (Train › Prepare › Plan Creator), retiring the overlay DOM +
  chrome CSS entirely. `renderPlansOverlay()` now hosts its list / editor / revision-history sub-views in `#trk-main`
  whenever `currentPage==='plan-creator'`; the entry points became page adapters — `openPlansOverlay()` resets the
  picker filters and `navTo('plan-creator')`, while `openPlanFull(id)` sets a transient `_plansDeepLink` so the page
  render opens straight to that plan's editor (plain menu / `openPlansOverlay` entries default to the list root via
  `renderPlanCreatorPage`). In-page sub-navigation (Edit · 🕘 History · ← All plans) re-renders within the page via
  the existing direct `renderPlansOverlay()` calls; the top-bar ◀ Back leaves the page. Picking **Use** now
  `navTo('workout')` (lands you on the dashboard with the plan active) instead of closing an overlay; the
  `closePlansOverlay()` shim is a thin `navBack()`. Dashboard deep-links (plan progress line, Plans / Change buttons,
  `#wc-plans-btn`) are unchanged — they flow through the same adapters. `planlist` / `minpct` / `planrevisions` /
  `plandash` specs updated to read `#trk-main` + assert `currentPage==='plan-creator'` instead of the retired
  `#plans-body` / `#plans-panel`.
- **Plan Detail → page (feat 183):** the detailed plan-execution view (feat 145/163/164) moved out of the
  `#plans-panel` overlay into the **router page `plan-detail`** (Train › Execute › Plan Detail). `openPlanExecution`
  now stashes the target plan/session ids and `navTo('plan-detail')`; `renderPlanDetailPage(main)` resolves the
  plan+session (explicit ids → else active) and hosts `renderPlanExecutionView` in `#trk-main` (a friendly empty
  state when there's no execution). The view's Back button is now a page `navBack()`. Every existing entry point
  (rest bar, step bar, session badges, dashboard progress) flows through `openPlanExecution`, so they all open the
  page unchanged. `test/planexec.spec.mjs` updated to assert `currentPage==='plan-detail'` + read `#trk-main`
  instead of the overlay. (feat 181 already turned the container-based screens — Log/History/Trends/Volume/Gyms/
  Body/Achievements — into working pages, so this kicks off the overlay→page conversions.)
- **Top-bar redesign — brand centered/topmost + Back/Forward (feat 182):** phase 2 of the nav rework makes the
  router visible. The **GymTracker315 brand** moved out of the tracker-panel header into a dedicated **centered,
  topmost row** of `#app-topbar` (tap → Home); below it a controls row carries **◀ Back / page-title / ▶ Forward**
  (`topbarBack`/`navForward`, disabled when the history stack is empty), then 🔊 ⚙️ ❓. The gear now routes to the
  Settings menu (`navTo('settings')`). The two-row bar made the topbar taller, so all fixed offsets (panel
  `padding-top`, `#trk-modal` / `#rest-bar` / `#plan-step-bar` positions, and their rest/step-bar combos) were
  refactored onto a single **`--topbar-h`** variable (`calc(var(--topbar-h) + …)`); `body.brand-hidden` both hides
  the brand row and collapses `--topbar-h` to the controls row, so the whole layout shrinks with one knob.
  `updateTopbarChrome()` keeps the title + Back/Forward state fresh each render; `_surfaceTracker()` brings the
  tracker panel forward on page navigations, and `topbarBack()` exits a Reference/Coaching slide-in back to the app.
  The legacy 📈/📚/🧭 panel switcher + 📖 glossary button are **hidden but kept in the DOM** (compat) until
  Reference/Advice become pages — then removed in feat 196; `coaching.spec`/`feedback.spec` now drive panels via
  `goPanel()`. Covered by `test/navtopbar.spec.mjs` (brand topmost+centered, hide collapses the offset, Back/Forward
  enable/disable, title, brand→Home + gear→Settings, hidden switcher + panel-exit Back); `restbaroverlap.spec`
  updated for the new offsets.
- **Page router — keystone of the nav rework (feat 181):** first phase of the total IA rework (drill-down pages +
  back/forward, per the approved plan). Adds a thin router over the existing renderers: a `PAGES` registry (`id →
  {title, emoji, kind:'menu'|'leaf', parent, tab?, render(main) | open()}`) covering the full target tree (Home ›
  Train{Reflect/Execute/Prepare}/Study/Settings), `navTo(id)` with a depth-capped back/forward stack
  (`navBack`/`navForward`, `localStorage gt_page`), and `renderMenu(main, children)` for the drill-down menus. The
  tracker `render()` now routes through `renderCurrentPage()` (dispatch on `currentPage`), but **everything stays
  backward-compatible**: `currentTab` is kept as a mirror, `switchToTab` routes through `navTo`, and a `_navTab`
  guard makes the legacy `currentTab = X; render()` pattern still work — so the 648 existing tests pass unchanged.
  Leaves not yet converted to pages (Exercise, Plan Detail, Reference, Glossary, Settings, …) carry an `open()` that
  calls their existing overlay opener, so the hierarchy is wired end-to-end while screens migrate incrementally
  (feat 182+). No content moved yet; the top bar is unchanged this phase. Every nav button has a unique emoji.
  Covered by `test/router.spec.mjs` (unique-emoji registry, leaf render + currentTab mirror + tab highlight, menu
  drill-down + item click, Back/Forward + parent-fallback + depth cap, legacy-opener leaves, switchToTab/`currentTab`
  compatibility, `gt_page` persistence).
- **Calendar view of the Log (feat 180):** the Log tab gains a **List / Calendar** toggle (`_logView`). The calendar
  (`renderLogCalendar`) draws a month grid (Sun-start) from `_sessionsByDay()`; each day with logged session(s) is
  highlighted and shows a **grade chip** (`sessionGrade`, colour-coded S/A→green … D→grey) or a dot, plus a **×N**
  badge for multiple sessions. **‹ / ›** page months (`_shiftMonth`, year-wrapping), **Today** jumps back to the
  current month, and tapping a workout day expands that day's full session card(s) below the grid (reusing
  `renderSession` + `bindSessionCards`). Today's cell and the selected day are outlined. View state is in-memory
  (`_logView` / `_calYM` / `_calSelDay`); the grade filter stays a List-view concern. Covered by
  `test/logcalendar.spec.mjs` (toggle routing, only-workout-days marked + ×N, day-select expands the cards + hint
  otherwise, month-wrap navigation, controls present).
- **Exercise-picker filters stack with the plan step (feat 179):** picking a plan-step chip in the exercise picker
  used to **override** the mega/sub/equip pills (it showed only the step's exercises and ignored the pills). Now a
  step change **resets** those pills + search to "all" (`resetPickerNormalFilters`) so every one of that step's
  compatible variations shows, and the pills/search then **stack** with (intersect) the step set instead of being
  ignored — letting you narrow *within* a step. The result count reads **"X of Y step-compatible variations shown"**
  while a step is active (`filterVariations` / `renderPickerResults`). Wired at all three step entry points: the
  picker step chip, `openStepPicker` (dashboard), and the post-save auto-advance. Covered by
  `test/planpicker.spec.mjs` (stacking intersection, filter-reset on entry, X-of-Y count).
- **Favorite plans & variations (feat 178):** a ★ toggle on every plan row and every exercise-picker row, backed by
  two synced settings maps (`state.favoritePlans` / `state.favoriteVars`, both in `SETTINGS_KEYS`, defaulted in
  `normalizeState`). Helpers `isFavPlan`/`toggleFavPlan` + `isFavVar`/`toggleFavVar` (+ a shared `favStarHtml`
  button) drive it; the star `stopPropagation`s so tapping it favorites without selecting the row. **Surfacing:**
  the exercise picker gains a **★ pill** (`modalState.pickerFavOnly`) that filters to favorites only, and within
  each family favorites **float to the top**; the plan picker gains a **★ Favorites chip** (`_plansFavOnly`, shown
  with a count when any exist) and favorites sort to the top of each category group. Favorites live in serialized
  state, so they persist locally and ride along cloud sync. Covered by `test/favorites.spec.mjs` (toggle idempotence
  + settings-key membership, normalize backfill, the picker star/float/filter, the plan star/chip/filter, and
  serialized-state persistence).
- **Rest-bar prev → next exercise heads-up (feat 177):** during between-sets rest the global rest bar now shows
  the exercise you just finished **and what's next**. `restBarNextExercise(prevUuid)` resolves the next by priority:
  (1) an exercise already **selected in the log but not started** (a queued pick), else (2) the **next incomplete
  step of the active explicit plan** (skipping the step the prev exercise belongs to), else (3) an **implicit
  pseudo-step** — `implicitNextSuggestion` names the least-trained main split this session (push/pull/lower/core),
  preferring a different split than the one just done, e.g. `Pull (suggested)` — else (4) nothing. The bar's sub-line
  becomes `prev → next` (plan steps tagged `(plan)`); when there's no next it keeps the existing rest-target range
  (the colour zone + countdown still encode target adherence). Inter-exercise rest now reads `prev → selected`
  instead of a bare "between exercises". Covered by `test/restbarnext.spec.mjs` (each tier of the chain, the
  null case, and the rendered `prev → next` bar).
- **Advisory suggested rest between steps (feat 176):** the detailed execution view now interleaves a small
  `💤 suggested rest ~m–m` divider between step cards, scaled by the heavier of the two adjacent steps' loads
  (`suggestedStepRestRange`: heavy 2½–4 min, moderate 1½–2½ min, light ¾–1½ min). It is **purely a guide** — the
  plan tracks no order (steps can be done in any sequence, with off-plan work in between), so unlike the feat-163
  between-exercise rest total, **nothing is ever measured against it**. A single-step plan shows no divider.
  Covered by `test/steprest.spec.mjs` (load scaling, N-1 dividers for N steps, none for a single step).
- **Plan length distribution — 90-min + 3-hour marks (feat 175):** the seed-plan library bunched at 30–60 min with
  a few 2-hour marathons and **nothing at the 90-minute or 3-hour marks**. Added a tranche-5: four **~90 min** plans
  (Full Body Builder, Upper Body Power, Leg Day, Push/Pull — 7 steps × ~5 sets) and three **~3 hour** marathons
  (Full Body Marathon, Leg Annihilation, Upper Body Epic — 10 steps × 6–8 sets), tuned so `estimatePlanMinutes`
  lands exactly on 90 / 180. The 3-hour plans carry honest descriptions (advanced, high-volume, run sparingly,
  manage fatigue). New ids append for existing users via the `seededPlanIds` merge. Distribution is now
  30/45/60/**90**/120/**180** min. Covered by `test/plans90180.spec.mjs` (clusters at 90 + 180, every option
  resolves, 3-hour plans fall in the picker's `long` bucket); `test/moreplans.spec.mjs` validates the new options too.
- **Plan authorship + revisions / audit trail (feat 162):** plans were silently auto-saved with no history. Now
  every plan carries an **`author`** (user plans → "You", seeds → "GymTracker315") and a numbered, append-only
  **revision history** (`plan.rev` + `plan.revisions[]`, each `{rev, at, author, note, content}` where `content`
  is a deep snapshot of name/desc/intensity/minPct/steps). The creator gains a **revision bar** — `rev N`, author
  (tap to edit), a dirty/clean badge, and **Commit / Revert / History** buttons. The editor still auto-saves the
  working **draft** (nothing is lost); **Commit** (`commitPlanRevision`) snapshots the draft as the next revision,
  **Revert** (`revertPlanToCommitted`) discards uncommitted edits, and **History** lists every revision (newest
  first) with **Restore-to-draft** (`restorePlanRevision`). Dirtiness is an id-independent content compare
  (`planContentSnapshot` → JSON) so reordering ids never shows a false change; `ensurePlanRevisioned()` backfills a
  baseline in `normalizeState` (idempotent) and the history is capped at 30. **Crucially, an execution is only ever
  compared to runs of the same revision**: `planUseForWorkout` stamps `session.planRev = plan.rev`,
  `findPlanExecutions(planId, excludeId, rev)` filters to that revision (no rev → legacy all-runs behaviour), and the
  detailed execution view judges a past run against `planAtRevision(plan, session.planRev)` — the exact content it
  ran, not a later, arbitrarily-different one (the view shows a `rev N` badge). Covered by
  `test/planrevisions.spec.mjs` (baseline, seed authorship, dirty→commit→clean, revert, restore, planAtRevision,
  same-revision comparison, planRev stamping, the editor bar).
- **Deep plan-execution analytics (feat 163):** the detailed execution view (feat 145) gains a full analytics
  layer from a session's set timestamps (`wTs` = set start, `ts` = set done). `computePlanExecutionDetail(session,
  plan)` (pure — also seeds the feat-164 snapshot) computes: the **actual step sequence** performed (off-plan
  exercises flagged inline), rest spent **within** exercises vs **between** exercises (clamped gap sums), **active**
  (under-tension) time, **% active for completed steps**, per-step **estimated vs actual** time (est uses an
  a-priori `DEFAULT_PER_SET_SEC`; actual is measured active+within), an **ETC drift series** (the projected finish
  recomputed at each completed set, drawn with `sparklineSvg`) plus its **delta from the plan's original estimate**
  (`estimatePlanMinutes`), and an **off-plan summary** (count / sets / active time / names of exercises that matched
  no step). The view renders an analytics panel (ETC + spark, a 4-up time grid, the sequence chips, the off-plan
  line) and a per-step `⏱ est · actual · %active` line; the panel is suppressed when a session has no timing data.
  Covered by `test/planexecdetail.spec.mjs` (exact active/within/between math, %active, est-vs-actual, sequence
  ordering, off-plan totals, ETC delta + series length, render integration, and graceful no-timing degradation).
- **Historized plan execution + end-of-workout recap (feat 164):** the detailed analytics (feat 163) are now
  **snapshotted onto the session** at workout end so a run stays reviewable later even if the plan changes or is
  deleted. `finalizeEndWorkout` calls `finalizePlanExecution(session)`, which judges the run at the revision it ran
  (`planAtRevision(plan, session.planRev)`) and stores `session.planExec = {at, planName, planRev, summary, detail,
  incomplete, skipped}` — where **incomplete** = steps started but left under their min% (`{label, logged, req}`)
  and **skipped** = steps never touched (`planIncompleteSkipped`). The execution view shows a finished-run recap
  banner (⚠ incomplete / ⏭ skipped, or "✓ Every step completed") for any ended session, and the Log session badge
  prefers the stored snapshot (and the run revision) for its `done/total` count and surfaces a `· N skipped` tag.
  The snapshot travels inside the session (so it syncs + exports for free). Covered by
  `test/planexechist.spec.mjs` (snapshot shape + incomplete/skipped classification, end-to-end finalize, the recap
  banner, the all-complete case, the Log badge, and no-recap-while-live).
- **Volume "Split" view (feat 119):** the Volume tab gains a **Split** level (alongside Group / Muscle / Heads) that
  aggregates the week's strength sets by **training split** — the family **mega** category (push / pull / lower /
  core / full). `getWeeklySplitVolume(weekOffset)` mirrors `getWeeklyVolume` but keys by `family.mega`;
  `renderVolumeSplit` draws the per-split bars (sets + %) plus a quick **push:pull** and **upper:lower** balance
  read. Covered by `test/volumesplit.spec.mjs`.
- **Richer Log workout cards (feat 120):** each `renderSession` card now shows a **grade chip** (`sessionGrade` —
  stored `finalScore` or live `computeWorkoutScore`), the **plan** it followed (explicit badge when `planId`, else an
  **inferred split** via `sessionSplitLabel` — push/pull/legs/upper/full-body/mixed from the mega mix, marked
  "implicit"), a **key-deltas** line (`sessionDeltaSummaryHtml`: 🏆 PR count, the biggest non-PR e1RM gainer, and #
  regressions vs each exercise's prior best), and — when the gap to the previous logged workout exceeds **48h** — a
  "🛌 rested N days" banner (`sessionGapTagHtml`). Covered by `test/logcards.spec.mjs`.
- **Picker "touched" familiarity badge (feat 121):** every exercise-picker row shows a discrete familiarity/recency
  chip — **new** if never trained, else **N×** (distinct calendar days you've logged it) colored by recency
  (recent ≤ 14 d / stale ≤ 60 d / old). `buildTouchMap()` does one pass over sessions per picker render
  (varUuid → distinct-day set + last timestamp); `touchBadgeHtml()` renders the chip (full "trained on N days · last
  X ago" in the tooltip). Covered by `test/touched.spec.mjs`.
- **Notes: gym + injury suggestions (feat 122):** the session-notes modal's **Location** field gets a `<datalist>`
  of your saved gyms (`state.gyms`) for quick autocomplete, and the **Injuries / Pain** field autocompletes from a
  curated `COMMON_INJURIES` list as you type. The injuries field is **multi-value** (comma-separated):
  `renderInjurySuggest()` matches the token after the last comma (excluding already-listed entries) and clicking a
  chip appends it + `, ` so you can list several. Covered by `test/notes.spec.mjs`.
- **End-workout confirm → add notes (feat 123):** `finalizeEndWorkout`'s confirm is now a 3-way `choiceDialog` —
  **🏁 End workout / 📝 Add notes, then end / Cancel**. Choosing notes opens the session-notes modal via a new
  `openNotesModal(date, onSaved)` callback; **Save** (relabeled "Save & End Workout") runs the chained `finish()` to
  end the workout, while closing the modal without saving cancels the end (`closeNotesModal` clears `_notesOnSaved`).
  Long-press End / plan-complete "End" still skip straight through (`skipConfirm`). Covered by `test/endnotes.spec.mjs`.
- **Cloud sync — Google Drive (feat 124, plan Phase 3):** automatic cross-device sync that works on the **phone**
  (unlike the desktop-only File-System Auto-Save/Load). A provider-agnostic engine sits behind the feat-95
  last-write-wins merge: a `SyncProvider` only reads/writes **one** canonical state JSON and `applyImport(remote,
  'merge')` reconciles edits/deletes (session `id` + `updatedAt` + tombstones). `saveState()` → `cloudPushTrigger()`
  (1.2 s debounce); boot does a silent `cloudPullNow`. Every push is **read-merge-write** (re-pull + merge before
  upload) so no device clobbers another. The first backend, **Google Drive**, uses the GIS browser token model
  (scope `drive.appdata` — a private per-app folder, light consent), stores one `gymtracker-state.json`, loads the
  Google Identity SDK **dynamically** on connect (keeps the app single-file + the no-external-`<script src>` lint),
  holds the access token **in memory only** (never persisted) and caches the Drive fileId in IndexedDB (`bioIdb*`
  `cloudGoogleFileId`). `state.cloudSync` is **device-local — intentionally NOT in `SETTINGS_KEYS`** so connection
  state never travels cross-device (each device authorizes with its own browser-scoped consent). The public OAuth
  client id lives in `SYNC_CLIENTS.google` (empty until the user does the one-time free Google Cloud setup — see
  README → Cloud Sync; until then the Settings card shows the setup steps instead of a Connect button). The engine
  is provider-pluggable: a custom-endpoint / Dropbox / OneDrive backend can be added by registering another entry in
  `CLOUD_PROVIDERS` with no engine changes. Covered by `test/sync.spec.mjs` (stubbed GIS + routed Drive REST:
  connect → find-or-create → push; pull → LWW merge; device-local-by-default).
- **Cloud sync — more backends (feat 125):** three more entries in `CLOUD_PROVIDERS`, no engine change. **Custom
  endpoint** (`kind:'endpoint'`) — the universal/Apple-friendly option: `GET`/`PUT` one JSON to a user-supplied
  URL with an optional bearer token (`state.cloudSync.perProvider.custom`, local only); ships a ~30-line Cloudflare
  Worker template [`tools/sync-worker.js`](tools/sync-worker.js). **Dropbox** + **OneDrive** (`kind:'oauth'`) share
  a hand-rolled **OAuth 2.0 PKCE redirect** flow (no SDK, no client secret): `cloudOAuthBegin` stashes a PKCE
  verifier + redirects to consent; on return the app boots with `?code=…`, `cloudOAuthHandleRedirect` exchanges it
  (`cloudOAuthExchange`) and finishes via the shared `cloudFinishConnect`. Access tokens stay in memory
  (`_cloudOAuthTokens`); **refresh tokens** persist in IndexedDB (`bioIdb*` `cloud_<provider>_rt`) so a reload
  re-syncs silently (`cloudOAuthToken` → `cloudOAuthForceRefresh` on expiry/401). Dropbox uses the content API
  (App-folder, `/gymtracker-state.json`); OneDrive uses Graph `special/approot` (personal accounts only —
  `Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder`). `cloudConnect` returns early when a provider's `connect()` reports `'redirecting'`.
  The Settings card became a provider picker (`cloudSyncCardHtml`) listing every backend + custom URL/token inputs +
  a Setup-help disclosure. iCloud stays out of scope (needs a paid Apple Developer account + CloudKit). Covered by
  `test/sync.spec.mjs` (PKCE digest; custom connect/push/pull with bearer auth; simulated Dropbox+OneDrive
  redirect-return → token exchange → push; registry + multi-provider picker render).
- **Two-hour seed plans (feat 126):** four high-volume `SEED_PLANS` for longer sessions — **Full Body Blast**,
  **Leg Marathon**, **Chest & Back**, and **Shoulders & Arms** (all "(2h)") — each tuned to ~45 sets across
  10–11 steps so `estimatePlanMinutes` (`round((2.5·sets + steps)/15)·15`) reports **~120 min**. They use only
  existing movement families (`_mvOpt` ids), so they inherit gym-feasibility, picker matching and progress
  tracking for free, and auto-append for existing users via the `seededPlanIds` merge in `normalizeState`.
  Covered by `test/app.spec.mjs` (present + 120-min estimate + every step references a real family).

## 2. State & storage

- `STORAGE_KEY = overload_tracker_v2` — the full `state` object (JSON).
- `PENDING_KEY = overload_tracker_pending_v2` — in‑progress log entry (incl. cardio / superset drafts).
- `LOG_KEY = overload_tracker_log_v1` — **separate** activity/error log; kept out of the data JSON.
- `SETTINGS_KEYS` — keys preserved on *merge* import / replaced on *overwrite* import.
- `normalizeState()` backfills nested defaults so older saved state stays valid.

### `state` shape (high level)

## 3. Feature catalog (as built)

### Data, backup & import/export — DONE
Export/import JSON (merge vs overwrite); auto‑save / auto‑load to file or folder with
deletion policies (Chromium); settings inside the JSON; CSV export of the reference.

**Workout export (50):** export a single workout (the `⤴` button on any session card) or a date
range (Settings → Data → *Export Workout / Range…*) as a **themed portrait image** and as **plain
text**. Scope presets: single workout · this week · this month · last 30 days · all‑time · custom
from/to (`selectSessionsForExport`). The image is drawn with the **Canvas 2D API** (zero‑deps — no
html2canvas / SVG `<foreignObject>`, which taints the canvas on iOS Safari): a header band in the
active theme's `--accent` (header text auto‑contrasted via `pickContrast`), a 2×3 stat grid
(duration · volume · sets · score · HR · calories), then the exercise list with top sets; height is
computed before sizing and scaled by `devicePixelRatio` for crisp output. Delivery shares one
`downloadBlob` helper (the JSON/CSV/log exporters were refactored onto it) plus `copyText`
(Clipboard API + `<textarea>`/`execCommand` fallback) and `shareExport` (Web Share with the PNG as a
`File` where `navigator.canShare({files})`). `buildWorkoutText()` produces clean, Strava‑ready text.

### Profile & preferences — DONE
- **Profile (34):** name, DOB→age, height, gender → BMI / relative‑strength context.
- **Hold‑to‑confirm (32):** press‑and‑hold replaces yes/no popups on destructive buttons.
- **Highlight → glossary (31):** select & hold text 5s to open the matching entry.

### Themes (22, 47) — DONE
**43 themes in 10 categories** — Classic, Grimdark, Animanga, Neon, Elemental, Mono, Gemstone, **Coffee, Bloom, Dusk**
— with oblique thematic names. The 5 original themes use CSS `[data-theme]` blocks; the rest are
**palette‑driven** via `mkTheme()` → CSS custom properties applied inline by `applyTheme()`.

### Workout session dashboard — DONE
Start/End (12) with confirmation (13); auto‑start/auto‑end; workout score vs prior sessions;
live chunky estimate (14); pace algorithm (28); a remaining‑exercises suggester (55, superseding balanced‑physique 15); per‑element
visibility toggles (33). **Forerunner stats (25):** manual avg HR / max HR / calories attached to
any session via an inline ❤️ editor on the session card.

### Smart rest timer & set lifecycle (51) — DONE
A set now **starts when its weight is entered** (`wTs`) and is **done when reps are entered** (`ts`); the reps
field stays locked until a weight is present (`isSetOpen`). Only **one open set** is allowed at a time, and an
open set left without reps for `workoutControls.abandonMinutes` (default 5) is reaped (`reapAbandonedSet`).
**Add Set:** single‑click adds an empty (or plate‑loader) set, double‑click pre‑fills the previous set's weight
(`addSetRow`); the old clone button is hidden. A global **rest bar** under the top bar — driven by a single 1 s
`restTick`, visible across tabs while a workout is active — shows the live *set‑active* time or the rest since the
last set, colour‑coded against a **recommended range** (`recommendRest`): research‑based bands by exercise nature,
adjusted by previous‑set intensity (overload level / e1RM / reps) and in‑session fatigue, then blended toward the
user's own median rest for that exercise (`medianInterSetRest`) as data accrues — clamped 1 s…10 min. Optional
vibrate / beep fire once per zone transition (settings toggles). The **timeline** draws `wTs→ts` duration bars +
rest gaps (inter‑exercise rest styled distinctly, legacy ticks for un‑timed sets), and the Log tab shows live
**set‑time / rest** analytics (`computeRestStats`) with inter‑exercise rest bucketed separately.

### Rest bar — opaque progress bar in the top bar (56) — DONE
The feat‑51 bar was reworked into a **solid, opaque** strip flush under the emoji top bar (zone colours no longer
use `rgba` whole‑bar tints, so page content never shows through). It now doubles as a **progress bar**: an
absolutely‑positioned `.rest-bar-fill` grows left→right to show how far through the *current* colour zone you are —
how close the next colour change is (`restZoneFill`: `restSec/minSec` in the orange zone,
`(restSec−minSec)/(maxSec−minSec)` in the green zone ⇒ 50 % at mid‑green; 100 % + flash in the red over‑zone, with
the flash now animating the *fill* rather than the whole bar so opacity is preserved). When **not** working out it
stays visible as a **compact 18 px strip** ("`<d>d <h>h since last set`" via `lastExerciseEndedMs`/`formatSinceGap`),
expanding to the 30 px timer while training; `body.rest-bar-on` (78 px) / `body.rest-bar-idle` (66 px) drive the
panel offset. Hidden only when the timer setting is off or no set has been logged yet.

### On-screen numpad for set entry (57) — DONE
An opt-in `workoutControls.onScreenNumpad` (Settings → On-screen numpad) replaces the native mobile keyboard for the
weight/reps set inputs, whose slide-in used to reflow the form ("jump around"). When on, `renderSetsForm` renders the
inputs as `type="text" inputmode="none" readonly` (no keyboard fires) and a tap opens a **fixed bottom-sheet numpad**
(`#trk-numpad`); being `position:fixed` it never reflows the form. Keys (digits · `.` · `±` · `⌫` · Clear · Next ·
Done) are built by the pure **`numpadApplyKey(buf, key, {decimal, sign, maxLen})`** — decimal only for weight and
time/distance reps, `±` for bodyweight "assist" weight, integer reps otherwise. Entry flows through the shared
**`commitSetField(i, f, val)`** (extracted from the native input handler, used by both paths) so `wTs`/`ts` stamping,
the reps-locked-until-weight rule, overload tags and the rest bar behave identically; `updateRowLive` was hoisted to
module scope so both paths can call it. With the option off, native keyboard entry is unchanged (cardio/superset/HR
inputs still use it).

### Set-form button rework + opt-in prefill (58) — DONE
The set-action buttons now live on one row — the modal footer is **Save · Add · Copy · Clear · Close** (the old hidden
Clone is gone; the body "+ Add Set" row and the "LAST: …" quick-fill row are removed). The footer `Add`/`Copy` are
sets-only (`renderModal` hides `#trk-add-set` for the picker/cardio/superset forms, since the footer is shared).
**Add Set** is now single-click = a fresh empty set (or the plate-loader default); the old double-click-for-previous-
weight behaviour is gone. **Copy** (`copyWeightToNextSet`) builds the *next* set's weight only: if the bottom set has a
weight it appends a new set carrying it (≡ the old double-click), else it fills the empty bottom set from the nearest
weighted set above, else from history (`getLastSetForExercise`) — it never copies reps. Auto-prefilling the first set
from the last session is now an **opt-in** `workoutControls.prefillFromHistory` (**default off**); the three
start-an-exercise prefill sites (picker tap, sub-option change, suggestion chip) are gated on it.

### Tracking modes — DONE
`exMode()` classifies a variation as **standard** (weight×reps), **bodyweight** (added load; − =
assist; shows effective load — feat 26), **distance** (carries — feat 27), or **time** (holds — 27).
**Cardio (feat 6)** is a fully separate path: `isCardioVar()` (mega `cardio`) routes the log modal to
`renderCardioForm()`, which captures elapsed time + optional distance/steps/power/setting/calories/
effort(1–5)/temp/weather/notes. Cardio entries store `cardio:{}` with empty `sets`, so they are
**excluded from volume, scoring, trends and progression history** but render with their metrics in
the session/history views.

### Plate loader (41/42) — DONE
For barbell movements (`isBarbellVar`), an optional collapsible loader in the sets form: pick a bar
(default 45 lb / 20 kg + variants), tap plates per side, see the live total, and **“Set as weight”**
fills empty sets and becomes the default weight for newly added sets. Symmetric only; a note explains
asymmetric is reserved for a few obscure lifts.

### Supersets — DONE (two distinct features)
- **Post‑hoc link (39):** a `⇄` button links a logged exercise with the one above it (shared `supersetId`).
- **Obscure real‑time superset (43):** a discrete “⇄ Superset two exercises” entry in the picker lets you
  pick exercise A then B, then add sets of **either** in any order; saved as two `supersetId`‑linked entries.
  Changing the chosen exercise discards the in‑progress superset, and a normal in‑progress set cannot be
  converted into a superset (you start superset mode fresh from the picker).

### Volume & muscle analysis — DONE
Body‑part, **per‑muscle (9)** and **per‑head (29)** views from a muscle model + per‑family contribution
map; adjustable **weightings (10)** scaling MEV/MAV/MRV targets with **cited sources** and revert‑to‑default;
imbalance **presets (11)**; over/under‑doing sort. **Cardio goals & adherence (7):** a card on the Volume
tab sets weekly minutes/distance/sessions goals and shows this‑period adherence bars (hidden when cardio
category is hidden).

### Session analytics (52) — DONE
A **Sessions** sub‑tab in Trends (`renderSessionTrends`) gives a light, *informational* read on training
habits — explicitly not progression. From `sessionTrendData()` (per‑session size/length/time, duration via
`endedAt` else last‑set time): summary tiles (avg length / sets / volume / typical start), sparklines for
per‑session **volume** and **duration** (`trendSparkSVG`), and bar charts (`trendBarsSVG`) for **time of day**
(6 buckets), **day of week**, and **workouts per week** (last 10). Reuses `computeSessionStats`/`lastSetTs`/
`startOfWeek`; charts are theme‑coloured via CSS vars.

### Categories visibility (8) — DONE
Settings → Categories hides **cardio / mobility / recovery** entirely: `categoryHidden()` removes them from
the picker (via `varVisibleInPicker`) and suppresses their features (e.g. cardio goals).

### Body composition (24) — DONE
`Body` tab: manual Garmin Index S2‑style entry (weight, body‑fat %, muscle/bone mass, water %), kg‑canonical,
displayed in lb/kg; BMI from latest weight + profile height; history with deltas.

### Reference, variations & glossary — DONE
Hide flags + reset (23); custom variations (16, manual‑flagged, removable only if unlogged, basis selectable);
built‑in extras (17/18 — Roc‑It dip/leg press/leg extension/leg curl/abdominal & oblique crunch, Life Fitness
torso rotation, hack‑squat foot positions, sissy hack squat); same‑stimulus alternatives with cues (19);
top‑bar glossary (20) & help (21); bodybuilder/lore entries (40) in a `Lore` category — **with no personal
lifespans (feat 45)**; **anatomy chart (30)** as a clickable left pane, bidirectionally cross‑linked to entries.

### Gyms (36/37/38/44/46) — DONE
Gym management is its **own tab (46)**. Define gyms by available equipment, build **from a template**,
select the **active** gym (overrides hide flags / force‑shows specific exercises), pin **GPS** (manual,
“pin here”, or **paste a Google Maps link / lat,lng — feat 44** via `parseMapsLatLng`), and a Maps **search**
link. Workout start pings location to auto‑select the nearest saved gym (≤2 km).

### Activity & error log (35) — DONE
Ring‑buffer event log in its own storage key; global error capture; in‑drawer viewer; export to `.txt`.

### UI chrome & build stamp (53) — DONE
The top app bar is **emoji‑only** (📈 / 📚 panel tabs · 📖 / ⚙️ / ❓ actions) to save width on mobile — no
wordmark, height stays 48px (so the rest‑bar/panel/picker offsets are untouched). The build identity is a
**single `APP_BUILD` constant** shown discreetly at the foot of the **Help** panel (not the top bar); a tracked
**`.githooks/pre-commit`** hook (`stamp-build.js`) rewrites it to `build <commit#> · <YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:MM>` on
every commit, so it never goes stale. The auto‑save status badge is a self‑contained fixed pill (decoupled
from the old top‑bar `#app-ts` anchor).

### Per‑exercise notes (54) — DONE
The log‑sets header (`.selected-exercise`) carries a **custom note that sticks to the exercise** —
add / edit / view / clear inline, persisted globally and re‑shown every time that exercise is logged (the
Strong/Hevy convention), independent of any session. Stored as `state.exerciseNotes[varUuid] = {text, updatedAt}`
keyed by **variation** (so the note is stable across grip/sub‑option changes); `getExerciseNote`/`setExerciseNote`
read/write it and `normalizeState` defaults the map. The header shows "📝 …note… · edit" when set and
"＋ Add note" when empty; an inline textarea (Save / Cancel / Clear) drives it, toggled by
`modalState.exNoteEditing` + a `renderModal()` re‑render, and reset on every modal open / exercise switch.

### Remaining‑exercises evaluation (55) — DONE
The live "what's left to round out this session" card (upgrades the feat‑15 balance card, same `dashboard.physique`
toggle). `computeRemainingWork(session)` finds the dominant mega and the still‑light **bodyparts** via `getBP()`
(the clean per‑exercise bodypart — `push`→chest/shoulders/triceps, `pull`→back/biceps, `lower`→quads/hams/glutes/calves,
`core`), then suggests one specific, currently‑visible exercise per missing area (excluding what's already done,
preferring the user's most‑used). Suggestions render as **tappable chips** — `startExerciseFromSuggestion(varUuid)`
opens the log modal preset to that exercise. Recomputed on every submit (it lives in `renderLog`). This also fixes a
latent feat‑15 bug: the old card tallied `family.sub` against keys (`triceps`/`biceps`/`core`) that are never a `sub`,
so those areas always read "light". The **projected grade** (Live score estimate) already reevaluated per submit and
is unchanged.

### Deferred — ONHOLD
- **#49** — Make the anatomy chart toggle to externally‑attached, more richly detailed charts and ensure the
  glossary covers everything on them. (Requires source charts that aren't provided; the built‑in stylized
  chart + comprehensive anatomy glossary ship today.)
- **#50‑Strava** — push the workout summary into the Strava activity the Garmin Forerunner
  auto‑generates (match by overlapping time window, then `PUT /activities/{id}` description). Deferred:
  Strava's API only exposes the activity *description/name* (no structured sets), and OAuth needs a
  server‑side secret + token refresh — so it requires a small backend (the same one the multi‑device
  sync question is parked on; a serverless worker would cover both). The text export is already
  Strava‑ready, so this becomes "authenticate + match + PUT" once a backend exists.

---

## 4. Notable design decisions
- **Palette‑driven theming** keeps each new theme to a single data entry, no per‑theme CSS.
- **Runtime injection over editing giant literals** for custom + built‑in‑extra variations.
- **Single picker‑visibility source of truth** (`varVisibleInPicker`) composes category‑hide, gym rules,
  hide flags and custom flags; gym force‑show wins for specific exercises.
- **Cardio is data‑shaped to opt out of strength math**: empty `sets` means every volume/score/trend
  function ignores it automatically; a guard in History skips zero‑set entries.
- **Separate log storage** so JSON export/import stays clean.
- **Two-layer test suite** (see §6): a zero-dependency static check (parses every inline `<script>`, lints,
  verifies the build stamp + Python helpers) plus a Playwright behavioral suite that boots the real file in
  headless Chromium and asserts the pure helpers + a clean boot. GitHub Actions runs both on every push/PR.

## 5. Known limitations
- Per‑muscle distribution is directional (explicit map for major lifts, even split otherwise), not lab‑accurate.
- The anatomy chart is a stylized schematic (see ONHOLD #49 for the richer‑chart follow‑up).
- Auto‑save/load and GPS need Chromium / geolocation permission; file handles reset on reload.
- Editing one of several cardio bouts of the *same* machine in a single session targets the first match.
- `parseMapsLatLng` reads coordinates from common Google Maps URL forms or a plain `lat,lng`; it does not call any Maps API.
- Rest analytics & the recommended‑rest blend only populate from sessions logged **after** feat 51 shipped (older sets lack the `wTs` start timestamp); they fall back to heuristics until then.
- The build stamp auto‑updates via a git pre‑commit hook; enable it once per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (Node must be on PATH). Each commit therefore touches `gym-tracker.html` with the refreshed stamp.
- Exercise notes are **global per variation** — the same note shows for every grip/sub‑option and in every session; they are intentionally not repeated on per‑session history rows or in the image/text export (easy follow‑ups).
- The remaining‑exercises suggester uses the coarse `getBP` bodypart map (compound lower lifts count as quads; only the four strength megas are covered) and surfaces one suggestion per missing area — a nudge to round out balance, not a full program.

## 6. Testing & CI
The app is one ~1.4 MB self‑contained file, so the test tooling lives alongside it (`package.json`, `test/`,
`playwright.config.mjs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and never touches the shipped HTML. Two layers:

**Layer 1 — static checks (`npm run check`, zero dependencies, ~1 s).** `test/check.mjs` extracts every inline
`<script>` block and parses each with `vm.Script` (this is what catches a stray token that would otherwise break
the whole script at load — the exact failure mode that has bitten this repo). It also lints for native
`confirm/alert/prompt` calls (the themed dialogs replaced them), `debugger` statements and external `<script src>`
(the file must stay single‑file); checks `APP_BUILD` is well‑formed; greps that the critical functions are still
defined; and `py_compile`s the three `tools/*.py` helpers. Wired into the pre‑commit hook so a parse break can't be
committed (bypass with `git commit --no-verify`).

**Layer 2 — behavioral suite (`npm test`, Playwright + headless Chromium).** `test/app.spec.mjs` serves the file
over `http://127.0.0.1` (a tiny zero‑dep server, `test/serve.mjs`) and, in an isolated context per test, asserts:
the app boots with **no console/page errors** and renders its shell; the critical globals are exposed; and the pure
helpers compute correctly — `estimated1RM` (Epley), `kgToLb`/`lbToKg` round‑trip, `parseMediaUrl`
(YouTube/TikTok/Instagram id extraction + junk rejection), `estimatePlanMinutes`/`intensityDots`, `autoLoadSupported`,
`normalizeState` → `saveState` sync defaults, and a silent `importStravaActivities` merge. `npm test` runs the static
checks first (`pretest`).

**CI.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs both layers on every push to `main`/`dev` and on PRs (Ubuntu, Node 20 +
Python 3, `npm ci`, then `playwright install chromium`), uploading the Playwright report as an artifact.

> The behavioral suite paid for itself on day one: its clean‑boot assertion caught a real shipped bug — the feat‑72
> HR auto‑reconnect call in the INIT block ran *above* the `let _hrConnected` declaration, so it threw a
> temporal‑dead‑zone rejection on every load and **auto‑reconnect never actually ran**. Fixed by deferring the call
> one tick (`setTimeout(hrTryReconnect, 0)`) so it fires after the script finishes initializing.
