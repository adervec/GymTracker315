# Gym Tracker — Design & As‑Built Spec

A single‑file, offline‑first progressive‑overload gym tracker plus an exhaustive
exercise reference. Everything (UI, data, exercise library, glossary, anatomy chart)
lives in **`gym-tracker.html`** — no build step, no dependencies, no network. All
user data is stored in the browser via `localStorage`, with optional file/folder
sync on Chromium desktop.

Guiding principle surfaced throughout the UI: **beat last session** — more reps,
more weight, or more sets. Strength sets are compared with estimated 1RM,
`e1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30)`.

The feature backlog lives in **`Fitness App Features.xls`** (legacy BIFF `.xls`).
Status legend used there: **DONE** shipped · **ONHOLD** deferred.

## 1. File architecture

`gym-tracker.html` is one HTML document with three top‑level `<script>` blocks that
share the global scope:

| Block | Role | Key contents |
|------|------|--------------|
| **1 — App logic** | The tracker | `FAMILIES` (compact, machine‑readable exercise data with UUIDs), state & storage, auto‑save/load, themes, settings drawer, volume/muscle model, muscle/cardio analytics, gyms, body comp, log modal, **`render()`** (tracker) |
| **2 — Reference & glossary** | The reference panel | `icons`, `exercises` (rich human‑readable docs sharing the same UUIDs), importance/difficulty ratings, body‑position tables, `glossary`, anatomy chart, **`renderRef()`** (reference) |
| **3 — Nav switcher** | Top‑bar panel switching | `switchPanel()`, build stamp |

Two parallel exercise datasets are intentional: **`FAMILIES`** drives logging,
the picker, volume and tracking; **`exercises`** drives the reference documentation.
They share variation **UUIDs**.

> **Adding/removing a variation touches BOTH datasets.** Put the variation in the readable
> `exercises` block (full cue/setup/movement/mistakes/programming/position docs) **and** in the
> compact `FAMILIES` JSON (`{id, uuid, title, cue, tip, warning, best, subscription}`) under the
> matching family — using the **same UUID** in both. Editing only `exercises` documents the move
> but leaves it unloggable (it won't appear in the tracker picker); editing only `FAMILIES` makes it
> loggable but undocumented. (E.g. the Freemotion functional-trainer variations — feat 59.)

> **Latent bug fixed earlier:** both blocks declared a global `function render()`;
> block 2's reference one clobbered block 1's tracker one after load. The reference
> function was renamed **`renderRef()`**. An init simulation (`node` + DOM stub) is
> used to confirm all three blocks evaluate with no runtime errors and that every
> render path executes. It has since caught real bugs (a `GYM_EQUIP` TDZ; a string
> escaping error) before they shipped.

### Panels, tabs & overlays
- **Top bar:** title · `📈 Tracker` / `📚 Reference` tabs · `📖 Glossary` · `⚙ Settings` · `? Help`
  (Reference vs Glossary now use distinct emoji — feat 48).
- **Tracker panel** tabs: `Log` · `History` · `Volume` · `Trends` · `Body` · `Gyms`.
- **Reference panel:** searchable/filterable movement library.
- **Overlays:** Settings drawer, Help panel, Glossary panel (with anatomy chart), Log modal, Notes modal.
- The Glossary overlay relocates to `<body>` on open so it works from any panel and is themed globally.
- **Glossary view (feat 59):** opens as a full page by default, or a right-side slide-in drawer
  (Settings → Reference → *Glossary view*, persisted as `glossaryAsPage`, default `true`). Same panel and
  content either way — page mode just drops the slide animation/backdrop and goes edge-to-edge. The panel's
  z-index sits above the top bar so its header/✕ are never occluded in either mode.
- **Settings drawer cleanup (feat 60):** the drawer template stays flat (`.drawer-section-title` + sibling
  rows); after every render, **`decorateSettingsSections()`** wraps each title + its following siblings into a
  collapsible `.drawer-section`, so the giant template is untouched. A header search box (kept *outside*
  `#settings-drawer-body` so it survives re-renders) drives **`applySettingsFilter()`** for row/section-level
  filtering. Collapse state is persisted in `state.settingsCollapse` (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`, so it survives reloads
  and is kept on merge-imports); the **Theme** section is collapsed by default (43 swatches were the bulk) and
  shows the active theme as a header hint. Theme swatches were also compacted (6 cols, 24px dots).
- **Internationalization groundwork (feat 61):** `t(key, params)` resolves a string for the active language
  (`state.lang`, persisted in `SETTINGS_KEYS`; default *and only* option `'en'`) with **current → English → raw
  key** fallback and `{name}` interpolation. **`applyI18n(root)`** translates static markup tagged with
  `data-i18n` (text) / `data-i18n-title` / `data-i18n-aria` / `data-i18n-placeholder` (attributes) and runs on
  load and on every **`setLang()`**. Adding a language is **data-only**: push to `LANGUAGES` (code + native name)
  and add a matching `I18N[code]` dictionary — the Settings → *Language* picker (built from `LANGUAGES`) and the
  switch machinery handle the rest. Only the top bar + settings chrome are wired so far; JS-rendered strings use
  `t()`, and section titles can be translated safely via a `data-sec-id` override (keeps collapse IDs stable).
- **Read-only mode (feat 62):** `state.readonly` (Settings → Preferences, default off). `isReadonly()` +
  `roBlocked(action)` gate the main write paths (`saveSets`, `startWorkout`/`endWorkout`, `deleteExercise`,
  history set-delete, `importData`, `saveBodyEntry`, `saveNotes`, gym add/delete/edit, reset-all); `render()`
  toggles a `body.readonly` class that hides the FAB and shows the `#ro-banner` indicator. Settings/preferences
  stay editable (so the mode can be turned back off).
- **Choice dialog + unsaved-set guard (feat 62):** `choiceDialog({title, message, choices})` is a reusable
  promise-based 3-button modal. `endWorkout()` now checks `hasUnsavedSets()` (unsaved sets sitting in `pending`)
  and forces **Save & end / Discard & end / Continue** before finishing via `finalizeEndWorkout()`. `saveSets()`
  now returns `true`/`false` so the dialog knows whether the save succeeded.
- **Biometric freshness (feat 63):** bodyweight exercises (`exMode().mode==='bodyweight'`) can't be saved with no
  recorded bodyweight (`getCurrentBodyweightKg()`). `startWorkout()` surfaces `biometricWarnings()` — bodyweight
  missing/stale by default (`warnStaleBodyweight`), other biometrics opt-in (`warnOtherBiometrics`, default off),
  threshold `biometricStaleDays` (default 14 ≈ 2 weeks). Configured in Settings → *Biometrics*.
- **OSK Next/Done swap + About (feat 62):** the on-screen numpad's *Next* and *Done* swapped places (Next → header,
  Done → primary action). Settings → *About* now carries an **Early Access** disclaimer, a *Built by Adam Eryavec,
  P.Eng. with Claude Code* credit, and the `APP_BUILD` stamp.
- **OSK calculator + log-set fixes (feat 65):** a persistent 🧮 toggle adds `( ) ÷ × − +` keys and a safe
  BEDMAS evaluator (`evalExpr`, input restricted to arithmetic) so `45+45×2` commits `135`. `addSetRow` now
  enforces ≤1 incomplete row (no more stacked blanks); the exercise picker re-renders results-only on keystroke
  (`renderPickerResults`/`bindPickerResults`) so the search ✕ no longer jiggles.
- **TTS + UI polish (feat 66/67):** `speakRandomTip()` reads a random cue/tip aloud on exercise select
  (`state.ttsTips`, default on). App-wide `user-select: none` (form fields exempt) — supersedes the old
  highlight→glossary gesture. Tips & Details has an *Open full reference entry* link (`openReferenceFor`).
- **Workout metronome (feat 69):** customizable audio+haptic beat (`state.metronome`: bpm/audio/freq/vol/haptic/
  accentEvery, in `SETTINGS_KEYS`). Engine is a `setInterval` ticker driving a WebAudio click + `navigator.vibrate`;
  on/off is **runtime-only and resets OFF on `startWorkout`/end**. Toggle + BPM ±5 live on the Log tab during a
  workout; full config in Settings → *Metronome*.
- **Muscle-volume roll-up fix (feat 69):** `MUSCLE_CONTRIB` uses head-level ids (e.g. `biceps-long/short`); the
  `'muscle'`-level Volume view never rolled them to the parent (`biceps`), so multi-head muscles read blank and
  only single-part muscles like **brachialis** showed. `getWeeklyMuscleVolume` now applies **`toMuscleContrib`**
  (head→parent) for muscle level, mirroring `toHeadContrib` for head level.
- **Workout plans (feat 70):** `state.plans` (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`, seeded once from `SEED_PLANS` — 8 plans:
  PPL / Upper / Lower / 2× Full Body / Core). A plan = `{id, name, steps:[{id, sets, options:[{type:'movement',
  familyId} | {type:'variation', uuid}]}]}` — ordered, **suggested-not-enforced** steps; each option is a whole
  movement or a specific variation. Optionally attached to a session via **`session.planId`** (changeable/
  abandonable mid-workout). On the Log tab `renderPlanGuide` shows the plan card (per-step `logged/target` sets,
  current/done state, tap-an-option to log it, **live ETA** from `computePlanETA` = remaining sets ×
  `computeRestStats` set+rest times, and a **⚠ gym** warning via `stepImpossibleInGym` when an active gym can do
  none of a step's options). The feat-55 auto PUSH/PULL/LOWER/CORE suggester (`computeRemainingWork`) is gated to
  run **only when no plan is attached**. The plans overlay (`#plans-panel`) is a full builder: list → editor
  (name, add/reorder/delete steps, per-step set count, add movement/variation options via a search picker) → use.
- **Plan descriptions, history & more plans (feat 71):** plans and steps carry an optional `desc` (shown on the
  card, list, and editor). Seeding is now **additive by id** with a `state.seededPlanIds` ledger (new seed plans
  append for existing users; deleted ones don't reappear) and **backfills descriptions** onto pristine seed
  plans. Library grew to **15** with rich theme/benefit blurbs, including **station / one-zone** plans (Squat
  Rack Strength, Dumbbell Corner, One Cable Station, Bench + Dumbbells) for staying posted up when the gym is
  packed, plus Arms Blaster / Glute Focus / Beginner Full Body. History (`renderSession`) shows a **plan badge**
  with full/partial completion (`stepStatus` over the session). The reference page's circular glossary **FAB was
  removed** — the top-bar 📖 is the single entry point.
- **Heart-rate monitor (feat 72):** **Web Bluetooth** (`navigator.bluetooth`, Android Chrome/Edge only) against the
  standard Heart Rate Service (`0x180D` / `0x2A37`) — connects to a BLE strap or a watch in *broadcast HR* mode
  (it cannot tap a watch bonded to its own app, or the phone's health store). `hrConnect()` (user gesture) picks +
  remembers the device in **`state.hrDevice`**; **`hrTryReconnect()`** auto-reconnects via `getDevices()` on load
  and at `startWorkout`, and a `gattserverdisconnected` retry loop keeps trying to get it back. Samples stream into
  **`session.hrSamples` = [[msFromStart, bpm], …]** at ~1 Hz (throttled saves); `hrFinalize` rolls them into
  `session.hr` avg/max on end. A Log-tab `renderHrBar` shows live BPM + connect/disconnect; **`renderHrChart`** draws
  the per-session trend with **set periods shaded** (`set.wTs→ts`) so the rise-during-set / recover-during-rest
  pattern is visible in history. Manual HR entry (feat 25) stays as the iOS fallback.
- **Garmin biometrics import (feat 73):** a browser cannot read Garmin directly (no public per-user API, internal
  Connect endpoints are non-CORS + behind SSO, no web access to the phone health store), so data arrives as a **file**.
  Body tab → **"Import biometrics"** (`#bc-import-btn`) reads a JSON or CSV via `importBiometrics()` →
  `parseBiometrics()`. **JSON** shape `{bodyComp:[{date, weightKg, bodyFatPct?, muscleMassKg?, boneMassKg?,
  bodyWaterPct?}], sleep:[{date, score?, note?}]}` (also accepts `weightLb`/`*MassLb`); **CSV** is tolerant — columns
  detected by header keyword (date/weight/fat/muscle/bone/water), unit inferred from the weight header (`lb`/`kg`,
  else `state.bodyCompUnit`). `normBiometricEntry()` normalizes to the canonical `bodyComp` entry (kg, noon-UTC date,
  rounded), merged **dedupe-by-calendar-day** exactly like `saveBodyEntry`. Sleep rows are matched to a workout's
  calendar day (`dayKey` anchors date-only strings to noon UTC so they don't slip a day in western TZs) and written to
  **`session.sleep`** (a short string, e.g. `"Score 78 · 7h12m"`), surfaced + editable in the workout-stats card
  (feat 25) and shown as `😴 …` in history. **`tools/garmin-sync.py`** (community `garminconnect` lib) logs in locally
  with the user's own credentials and writes that JSON from Index S2 body-comp + last-night sleep score. Kept lean:
  one optional sleep field, no per-metric ingestion beyond the S2 set.
- **Biometrics auto-load (feat 73):** Settings → Data → **"Biometrics Auto-Load (Garmin)"** picks a file or folder
  (`bioLoadPickFile`/`bioLoadPickFolder`) and **always merges** (never overwrites) — independent of the main
  Auto-Save/Load; `state.bioAutoLoad{enabled,mode}`. Unlike the main Auto-Load (memory-only handles), the handle is
  **persisted in IndexedDB** (`gymtracker-fs` store; tiny `bioIdbGet/Set/Del` wrappers) so it survives reloads.
  `bioLoadNow(silent, interactive)` restores it, checks `queryPermission` on boot (silent, no prompt) /
  `requestPermission` on the **Sync Now** gesture, then imports via `importBiometrics(text, {silent})`. Folder mode reads
  the newest file matching `bio|garmin|weight|gymtracker` (`.json|.csv|.txt`) by last-modified. Boot hook fires
  `bioLoadNow(true,false)` after the main auto-load. `importBiometrics` now takes `{silent}` and returns
  `{added, sleepN}` for status reporting.
- **Sound & haptics quick control (feat 74):** a top-bar button (`#app-sound-btn`, left of the glossary icon) opens a
  themed popover (`#sound-menu` + transparent backdrop, anchored under the button via `getBoundingClientRect`) to
  mute/adjust master **Audio** (toggle + volume slider) and **Haptics** (toggle), with a **Test** button and a
  "Sound settings →" link to the drawer. New master gate **`state.sound{audio,haptics,volume}`** (in `SETTINGS_KEYS`,
  normalized + volume-clamped) is enforced inside the four audio/haptic primitives — `safeVibrate` (haptics gate),
  `restBeep`/`metroBeep` (audio gate + `sndVol()` scaling), and `speakRandomTip` (audio gate + `u.volume`) — so one
  switch silences everything app-wide. Helpers `sndAudioOn/sndHapticOn/sndVol`. The icon reflects live state via
  `refreshSoundIcon()`: speaker glyph by volume (🔇/🔈/🔉/🔊) plus a 📳 badge shown only when haptics are on, and a
  dimmed `muted-all` state when both are off. Called on boot and after every change. Below the master controls a
  **"Per sound"** section (`soundSources()`) exposes the individual channels as 🔊/📳 chips wired straight to their
  settings — Metronome (`metronome.audio/haptic`), Rest cues (`workoutControls.feedbackBeep/feedbackVibrate`) and
  Spoken tips (`ttsTips`); the master switch still gates them all. Menu scrolls (`max-height`) on short screens.

## 2. State & storage

- `STORAGE_KEY = overload_tracker_v2` — the full `state` object (JSON).
- `PENDING_KEY = overload_tracker_pending_v2` — in‑progress log entry (incl. cardio / superset drafts).
- `LOG_KEY = overload_tracker_log_v1` — **separate** activity/error log; kept out of the data JSON.
- `SETTINGS_KEYS` — keys preserved on *merge* import / replaced on *overwrite* import.
- `normalizeState()` backfills nested defaults so older saved state stays valid.

### `state` shape (high level)

## 3. Feature catalog (as built)

### Data, backup & import/export — DONE
Export/import JSON (merge vs overwrite); auto‑save / auto‑load to file or folder with
deletion policies (Chromium); settings inside the JSON; CSV export of the reference.

**Workout export (50):** export a single workout (the `⤴` button on any session card) or a date
range (Settings → Data → *Export Workout / Range…*) as a **themed portrait image** and as **plain
text**. Scope presets: single workout · this week · this month · last 30 days · all‑time · custom
from/to (`selectSessionsForExport`). The image is drawn with the **Canvas 2D API** (zero‑deps — no
html2canvas / SVG `<foreignObject>`, which taints the canvas on iOS Safari): a header band in the
active theme's `--accent` (header text auto‑contrasted via `pickContrast`), a 2×3 stat grid
(duration · volume · sets · score · HR · calories), then the exercise list with top sets; height is
computed before sizing and scaled by `devicePixelRatio` for crisp output. Delivery shares one
`downloadBlob` helper (the JSON/CSV/log exporters were refactored onto it) plus `copyText`
(Clipboard API + `<textarea>`/`execCommand` fallback) and `shareExport` (Web Share with the PNG as a
`File` where `navigator.canShare({files})`). `buildWorkoutText()` produces clean, Strava‑ready text.

### Profile & preferences — DONE
- **Profile (34):** name, DOB→age, height, gender → BMI / relative‑strength context.
- **Hold‑to‑confirm (32):** press‑and‑hold replaces yes/no popups on destructive buttons.
- **Highlight → glossary (31):** select & hold text 5s to open the matching entry.

### Themes (22, 47) — DONE
**43 themes in 10 categories** — Classic, Grimdark, Animanga, Neon, Elemental, Mono, Gemstone, **Coffee, Bloom, Dusk**
— with oblique thematic names. The 5 original themes use CSS `[data-theme]` blocks; the rest are
**palette‑driven** via `mkTheme()` → CSS custom properties applied inline by `applyTheme()`.

### Workout session dashboard — DONE
Start/End (12) with confirmation (13); auto‑start/auto‑end; workout score vs prior sessions;
live chunky estimate (14); pace algorithm (28); a remaining‑exercises suggester (55, superseding balanced‑physique 15); per‑element
visibility toggles (33). **Forerunner stats (25):** manual avg HR / max HR / calories attached to
any session via an inline ❤️ editor on the session card.

### Smart rest timer & set lifecycle (51) — DONE
A set now **starts when its weight is entered** (`wTs`) and is **done when reps are entered** (`ts`); the reps
field stays locked until a weight is present (`isSetOpen`). Only **one open set** is allowed at a time, and an
open set left without reps for `workoutControls.abandonMinutes` (default 5) is reaped (`reapAbandonedSet`).
**Add Set:** single‑click adds an empty (or plate‑loader) set, double‑click pre‑fills the previous set's weight
(`addSetRow`); the old clone button is hidden. A global **rest bar** under the top bar — driven by a single 1 s
`restTick`, visible across tabs while a workout is active — shows the live *set‑active* time or the rest since the
last set, colour‑coded against a **recommended range** (`recommendRest`): research‑based bands by exercise nature,
adjusted by previous‑set intensity (overload level / e1RM / reps) and in‑session fatigue, then blended toward the
user's own median rest for that exercise (`medianInterSetRest`) as data accrues — clamped 1 s…10 min. Optional
vibrate / beep fire once per zone transition (settings toggles). The **timeline** draws `wTs→ts` duration bars +
rest gaps (inter‑exercise rest styled distinctly, legacy ticks for un‑timed sets), and the Log tab shows live
**set‑time / rest** analytics (`computeRestStats`) with inter‑exercise rest bucketed separately.

### Rest bar — opaque progress bar in the top bar (56) — DONE
The feat‑51 bar was reworked into a **solid, opaque** strip flush under the emoji top bar (zone colours no longer
use `rgba` whole‑bar tints, so page content never shows through). It now doubles as a **progress bar**: an
absolutely‑positioned `.rest-bar-fill` grows left→right to show how far through the *current* colour zone you are —
how close the next colour change is (`restZoneFill`: `restSec/minSec` in the orange zone,
`(restSec−minSec)/(maxSec−minSec)` in the green zone ⇒ 50 % at mid‑green; 100 % + flash in the red over‑zone, with
the flash now animating the *fill* rather than the whole bar so opacity is preserved). When **not** working out it
stays visible as a **compact 18 px strip** ("`<d>d <h>h since last set`" via `lastExerciseEndedMs`/`formatSinceGap`),
expanding to the 30 px timer while training; `body.rest-bar-on` (78 px) / `body.rest-bar-idle` (66 px) drive the
panel offset. Hidden only when the timer setting is off or no set has been logged yet.

### On-screen numpad for set entry (57) — DONE
An opt-in `workoutControls.onScreenNumpad` (Settings → On-screen numpad) replaces the native mobile keyboard for the
weight/reps set inputs, whose slide-in used to reflow the form ("jump around"). When on, `renderSetsForm` renders the
inputs as `type="text" inputmode="none" readonly` (no keyboard fires) and a tap opens a **fixed bottom-sheet numpad**
(`#trk-numpad`); being `position:fixed` it never reflows the form. Keys (digits · `.` · `±` · `⌫` · Clear · Next ·
Done) are built by the pure **`numpadApplyKey(buf, key, {decimal, sign, maxLen})`** — decimal only for weight and
time/distance reps, `±` for bodyweight "assist" weight, integer reps otherwise. Entry flows through the shared
**`commitSetField(i, f, val)`** (extracted from the native input handler, used by both paths) so `wTs`/`ts` stamping,
the reps-locked-until-weight rule, overload tags and the rest bar behave identically; `updateRowLive` was hoisted to
module scope so both paths can call it. With the option off, native keyboard entry is unchanged (cardio/superset/HR
inputs still use it).

### Set-form button rework + opt-in prefill (58) — DONE
The set-action buttons now live on one row — the modal footer is **Save · Add · Copy · Clear · Close** (the old hidden
Clone is gone; the body "+ Add Set" row and the "LAST: …" quick-fill row are removed). The footer `Add`/`Copy` are
sets-only (`renderModal` hides `#trk-add-set` for the picker/cardio/superset forms, since the footer is shared).
**Add Set** is now single-click = a fresh empty set (or the plate-loader default); the old double-click-for-previous-
weight behaviour is gone. **Copy** (`copyWeightToNextSet`) builds the *next* set's weight only: if the bottom set has a
weight it appends a new set carrying it (≡ the old double-click), else it fills the empty bottom set from the nearest
weighted set above, else from history (`getLastSetForExercise`) — it never copies reps. Auto-prefilling the first set
from the last session is now an **opt-in** `workoutControls.prefillFromHistory` (**default off**); the three
start-an-exercise prefill sites (picker tap, sub-option change, suggestion chip) are gated on it.

### Tracking modes — DONE
`exMode()` classifies a variation as **standard** (weight×reps), **bodyweight** (added load; − =
assist; shows effective load — feat 26), **distance** (carries — feat 27), or **time** (holds — 27).
**Cardio (feat 6)** is a fully separate path: `isCardioVar()` (mega `cardio`) routes the log modal to
`renderCardioForm()`, which captures elapsed time + optional distance/steps/power/setting/calories/
effort(1–5)/temp/weather/notes. Cardio entries store `cardio:{}` with empty `sets`, so they are
**excluded from volume, scoring, trends and progression history** but render with their metrics in
the session/history views.

### Plate loader (41/42) — DONE
For barbell movements (`isBarbellVar`), an optional collapsible loader in the sets form: pick a bar
(default 45 lb / 20 kg + variants), tap plates per side, see the live total, and **“Set as weight”**
fills empty sets and becomes the default weight for newly added sets. Symmetric only; a note explains
asymmetric is reserved for a few obscure lifts.

### Supersets — DONE (two distinct features)
- **Post‑hoc link (39):** a `⇄` button links a logged exercise with the one above it (shared `supersetId`).
- **Obscure real‑time superset (43):** a discrete “⇄ Superset two exercises” entry in the picker lets you
  pick exercise A then B, then add sets of **either** in any order; saved as two `supersetId`‑linked entries.
  Changing the chosen exercise discards the in‑progress superset, and a normal in‑progress set cannot be
  converted into a superset (you start superset mode fresh from the picker).

### Volume & muscle analysis — DONE
Body‑part, **per‑muscle (9)** and **per‑head (29)** views from a muscle model + per‑family contribution
map; adjustable **weightings (10)** scaling MEV/MAV/MRV targets with **cited sources** and revert‑to‑default;
imbalance **presets (11)**; over/under‑doing sort. **Cardio goals & adherence (7):** a card on the Volume
tab sets weekly minutes/distance/sessions goals and shows this‑period adherence bars (hidden when cardio
category is hidden).

### Session analytics (52) — DONE
A **Sessions** sub‑tab in Trends (`renderSessionTrends`) gives a light, *informational* read on training
habits — explicitly not progression. From `sessionTrendData()` (per‑session size/length/time, duration via
`endedAt` else last‑set time): summary tiles (avg length / sets / volume / typical start), sparklines for
per‑session **volume** and **duration** (`trendSparkSVG`), and bar charts (`trendBarsSVG`) for **time of day**
(6 buckets), **day of week**, and **workouts per week** (last 10). Reuses `computeSessionStats`/`lastSetTs`/
`startOfWeek`; charts are theme‑coloured via CSS vars.

### Categories visibility (8) — DONE
Settings → Categories hides **cardio / mobility / recovery** entirely: `categoryHidden()` removes them from
the picker (via `varVisibleInPicker`) and suppresses their features (e.g. cardio goals).

### Body composition (24) — DONE
`Body` tab: manual Garmin Index S2‑style entry (weight, body‑fat %, muscle/bone mass, water %), kg‑canonical,
displayed in lb/kg; BMI from latest weight + profile height; history with deltas.

### Reference, variations & glossary — DONE
Hide flags + reset (23); custom variations (16, manual‑flagged, removable only if unlogged, basis selectable);
built‑in extras (17/18 — Roc‑It dip/leg press/leg extension/leg curl/abdominal & oblique crunch, Life Fitness
torso rotation, hack‑squat foot positions, sissy hack squat); same‑stimulus alternatives with cues (19);
top‑bar glossary (20) & help (21); bodybuilder/lore entries (40) in a `Lore` category — **with no personal
lifespans (feat 45)**; **anatomy chart (30)** as a clickable left pane, bidirectionally cross‑linked to entries.

### Gyms (36/37/38/44/46) — DONE
Gym management is its **own tab (46)**. Define gyms by available equipment, build **from a template**,
select the **active** gym (overrides hide flags / force‑shows specific exercises), pin **GPS** (manual,
“pin here”, or **paste a Google Maps link / lat,lng — feat 44** via `parseMapsLatLng`), and a Maps **search**
link. Workout start pings location to auto‑select the nearest saved gym (≤2 km).

### Activity & error log (35) — DONE
Ring‑buffer event log in its own storage key; global error capture; in‑drawer viewer; export to `.txt`.

### UI chrome & build stamp (53) — DONE
The top app bar is **emoji‑only** (📈 / 📚 panel tabs · 📖 / ⚙️ / ❓ actions) to save width on mobile — no
wordmark, height stays 48px (so the rest‑bar/panel/picker offsets are untouched). The build identity is a
**single `APP_BUILD` constant** shown discreetly at the foot of the **Help** panel (not the top bar); a tracked
**`.githooks/pre-commit`** hook (`stamp-build.js`) rewrites it to `build <commit#> · <YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:MM>` on
every commit, so it never goes stale. The auto‑save status badge is a self‑contained fixed pill (decoupled
from the old top‑bar `#app-ts` anchor).

### Per‑exercise notes (54) — DONE
The log‑sets header (`.selected-exercise`) carries a **custom note that sticks to the exercise** —
add / edit / view / clear inline, persisted globally and re‑shown every time that exercise is logged (the
Strong/Hevy convention), independent of any session. Stored as `state.exerciseNotes[varUuid] = {text, updatedAt}`
keyed by **variation** (so the note is stable across grip/sub‑option changes); `getExerciseNote`/`setExerciseNote`
read/write it and `normalizeState` defaults the map. The header shows "📝 …note… · edit" when set and
"＋ Add note" when empty; an inline textarea (Save / Cancel / Clear) drives it, toggled by
`modalState.exNoteEditing` + a `renderModal()` re‑render, and reset on every modal open / exercise switch.

### Remaining‑exercises evaluation (55) — DONE
The live "what's left to round out this session" card (upgrades the feat‑15 balance card, same `dashboard.physique`
toggle). `computeRemainingWork(session)` finds the dominant mega and the still‑light **bodyparts** via `getBP()`
(the clean per‑exercise bodypart — `push`→chest/shoulders/triceps, `pull`→back/biceps, `lower`→quads/hams/glutes/calves,
`core`), then suggests one specific, currently‑visible exercise per missing area (excluding what's already done,
preferring the user's most‑used). Suggestions render as **tappable chips** — `startExerciseFromSuggestion(varUuid)`
opens the log modal preset to that exercise. Recomputed on every submit (it lives in `renderLog`). This also fixes a
latent feat‑15 bug: the old card tallied `family.sub` against keys (`triceps`/`biceps`/`core`) that are never a `sub`,
so those areas always read "light". The **projected grade** (Live score estimate) already reevaluated per submit and
is unchanged.

### Deferred — ONHOLD
- **#49** — Make the anatomy chart toggle to externally‑attached, more richly detailed charts and ensure the
  glossary covers everything on them. (Requires source charts that aren't provided; the built‑in stylized
  chart + comprehensive anatomy glossary ship today.)
- **#50‑Strava** — push the workout summary into the Strava activity the Garmin Forerunner
  auto‑generates (match by overlapping time window, then `PUT /activities/{id}` description). Deferred:
  Strava's API only exposes the activity *description/name* (no structured sets), and OAuth needs a
  server‑side secret + token refresh — so it requires a small backend (the same one the multi‑device
  sync question is parked on; a serverless worker would cover both). The text export is already
  Strava‑ready, so this becomes "authenticate + match + PUT" once a backend exists.

## 4. Notable design decisions
- **Palette‑driven theming** keeps each new theme to a single data entry, no per‑theme CSS.
- **Runtime injection over editing giant literals** for custom + built‑in‑extra variations.
- **Single picker‑visibility source of truth** (`varVisibleInPicker`) composes category‑hide, gym rules,
  hide flags and custom flags; gym force‑show wins for specific exercises.
- **Cardio is data‑shaped to opt out of strength math**: empty `sets` means every volume/score/trend
  function ignores it automatically; a guard in History skips zero‑set entries.
- **Separate log storage** so JSON export/import stays clean.
- **Headless validation harness** (`node` + DOM stub) runs all blocks and exercises every render path.

## 5. Known limitations
- Per‑muscle distribution is directional (explicit map for major lifts, even split otherwise), not lab‑accurate.
- The anatomy chart is a stylized schematic (see ONHOLD #49 for the richer‑chart follow‑up).
- Auto‑save/load and GPS need Chromium / geolocation permission; file handles reset on reload.
- Editing one of several cardio bouts of the *same* machine in a single session targets the first match.
- `parseMapsLatLng` reads coordinates from common Google Maps URL forms or a plain `lat,lng`; it does not call any Maps API.
- Rest analytics & the recommended‑rest blend only populate from sessions logged **after** feat 51 shipped (older sets lack the `wTs` start timestamp); they fall back to heuristics until then.
- The build stamp auto‑updates via a git pre‑commit hook; enable it once per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (Node must be on PATH). Each commit therefore touches `gym-tracker.html` with the refreshed stamp.
- Exercise notes are **global per variation** — the same note shows for every grip/sub‑option and in every session; they are intentionally not repeated on per‑session history rows or in the image/text export (easy follow‑ups).
- The remaining‑exercises suggester uses the coarse `getBP` bodypart map (compound lower lifts count as quads; only the four strength megas are covered) and surfaces one suggestion per missing area — a nudge to round out balance, not a full program.
